The Madridistas understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these theoretical concepts, to realise that they’re not just bullshit- they say something about SOCCER. As a consequence people who don't think CR7 should win Balon D'Or truly ARE messi fanboys- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in CR7 catchphrase “SSSIUHHHHHHH,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Maradona - Live is life.

Like how you often see Ronaldo antifans in social media always says: tapinaldo, penaldo, small games player blabla... She is exactly that in real life. She hates Ronaldo so much, also she hates his arrogant personality. I on the other side am very neutral about Messi and Ronaldo, I convinced her to watch all the Real Madrid games in Champions League with me during the Zidane era. I still vividly remember her dying a little bit inside everytime she saw Ronaldo scores a goal and try to find excuses to deny his greatness. I can tell she gradually started to feel guilty/ashamed if she goes against herself and admit Ronaldo is great so she remained stubborn and disapprove of Ronaldo as long as she can. But surely after the 3 CL winnings, the Euro 2016, balloon dior winner, I think she must have enough. One day, out of the blue, she suddenly confess to me: she has been following Ronaldo Instagram for a while and she admit she started to become a big fan of Ronaldo.\\n\\nHahaha you guys can't imagine, this is the biggest switch or change of opinion that I have ever encountered during my 30 years in life.\",\n",

Nevermind the Young Boys mistake, Jesse is making his own waves now. Cavani looked likely too when on, worked hard to keep a chance alive etc. Both Matic and Fred played a couple of nice balls forward too.\\n\\nLook, we didn't play well we can't pretend like we did (except for De Gea, who was amazing), but I admire the gear turning up, the fight for the win at the end. I've been plenty critical of Ole, but he knew he needed the win tonight so he threw on the second striker, and left Ronaldo on, and it paid off.

The price that was paid for me shows the difference.\"\\n\\nFebruary 2011: \"I’m not going to answer the question, everyone already knows that I’m better than Messi.\"\\n\\nSeptember 2011: \"They whistle me (on \\'Messi, Messi\\' whistles to him in Spanish stadiums) because I’m better than their player. They’re envious. Those who does this are idiots.

Do You know what he did? Do You know or you don’t? He was eliminated in Copa America in his own country. I think that’s worse, don’t you?\"\\n\\nDecember 2012: \"I should’ve won the last 3 Ballon d’Ors, but it doesn’t depend on me.\"\\n\\nFebruary 2013: \"It doesn’t surprise me that Messi didn’t vote for me in the Ballon D’or, we know the reason.\" Ronaldo never voted for Messi, while Messi did in some years.\\n\\nAugust 2014 regarding to winning UEFA’s best player: \"If I didn’t win this award it wouldn’t surprise me, because nothing surprises me anymore after what happened with the Ballon d\\'Or in the prior years.\"\\n\\nWhen Messi won his 5th Ballon d\\'Or in 2015, Cristiano said: \"For me the European Golden Shoe is better than Ballon d\\'Or because it\\'s won by your goals and not by votes. It\\'s the best award out there\" Cristiano had more Golden Shoes that time. Today Messi has 2 more than him. 6 Golden Shoes.\\n\\nJanuary 2017, during Fifa Best award ceremony: \"I’m sorry for certain Barcelona people not being here, that’s speaks for itself, but I understand that.\" Note: Barcelona had a crucial away game the next day. Also Cristiano boycotted most of the ceremonies he lost.\\n\\nDecember 2018: \"Maybe Messi misses me.\\xa0I played in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal, in the national team, while he is still in Spain.\\xa0Maybe he needs me more.\\xa0For me, life is a challenge, I like it, and I like to make people happy.\\xa0I would like him to come to Italy one day.\" Former teammate Ryan Giggs stated: \"Ronaldo is obsessed with being Messi, there are no two ways about it. Cristiano\\'s latest comments about Lionel Messi prove I\\'m right. \\'I did it in England, I did it in Spain, I\\'m going to do it in Italy.

They still put the man in 6th grade... Do you really think 5 guys made more than him last year? Never. He could fight for that prize easily and the fight would be good with Lewandowski who in individual numbers was incredible and Bayern had a better season than Juventus and has been having a quieter season than United but level the selection for example Cristiano was way better And the prize goes to whom? For Messi who only won Copa do Rei for Barcelona, hasn't scored a goal against Real Madrid since Cristiano left, missed in the big games of the season, won Copa America which was supposed to be 4 in 4 years and they do pretty much everything year. He didn't score in the final and not in the semifinals. And it's been a weak season for PSG individually. For Cristiano to win this award he has to be 300% unquestionable. It's no use scoring the most beautiful bike of the year, being champion of everything for a club, top scorer of everything and scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup, they still find a way to get his prize. Already with Messi it's the opposite. He can have a low season, way down they'll always find a way to favor him and give him the award. Steal. Dirt. Shame. It's just unfortunate, Who saw it, saw it Those who are intelligent enough know who deserve the truth. Receiving awards without deserving it, is false happiness, without pride. Regardless of those awards, CR7 will always be the best in history!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCristiano: Factos 👍👀\",\n",

Ok the tide has turned on Maguire this year but there’s so many second raters there that are the real problem. The solution apparently is kane and zaha. Another £150m+ at least that will have terrible returns. United need to build for the future, offload a lot of their biggest earners, replace the aged with young, cheaper talent. Won’t buy immediate success but chasing that over the past 5+ years is what’s got them into this hole. The van persie signing even under fergie was the start of their demise as they pissed money up a wall for one last league title. As a Liverpool fan I find their misfortune hilarious and the fact they’ve seemingly learnt nothing from years of failure quite enjoyable. Thought they bucked the trend last year with the savvy ighalo signing but they’ve reverted to chasing stars, most of whom don’t want anything to do with a team that’s going to be in the europa league next year.',\n",

He doing know the meaning of respect at Manchester United, only hero worship.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/21/manchesterunited.premierleague1\\n\\n\\n\\n> First of all a little story to tell you what kind of man we are talking about. It is January 9, 2008, and in an upstairs room at Manchester United's training ground five elderly men in smart blazers are struggling with their emotions in front of a hushed audience. It is the club's media day building up to the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster and Sir Bobby Charlton's polite smile does not hide the fact he is trembling as he takes his seat. Bill Foulkes is straight-backed and dignified but only a couple of questions have been asked before the tears appear in his eyes and he reaches for a glass of water.\\n\\n\\n>In an adjacent room Wayne Rooney has agreed to offer a modern-day perspective of that seminal day when 23 people, including eight members of Sir Matt Busby's team, were killed in the wreckage of the burnt-out BEA Elizabethan. It is not his specialist subject but he handles the occasion with dignity and more eloquence than some people might imagine. But then Cristiano Ronaldo comes through the double doors and the mood is broken.\\n\\n\\n>He is wearing a white suit jacket and ripped jeans, looking every bit the boy-band hunk, but it is very obvious he is in a bad mood. He begins by berating Karen Shotbolt, the club's press officer, because he is waiting for Rooney and the event has over-run. He is banging his watch with his hand, flapping his arms and gesturing in the way that Portuguese footballers usually reserve for fussy referees and, at first, he is so animated it appears as if it might be a wind-up.\\n\\n\\n>When he flounces back through the doors, cursing loudly, it is very obvious he is being deadly serious. Rooney is professional enough to carry on with his tribute but the attention is no longer exclusively on him. Thirty seconds later Ronaldo appears again, first rapping his forefinger against the glass in the door, then opening it by a fraction and starting to whistle at Rooney in the way that a farmer beckons his sheepdog.\\n\\n\\n>It was such an unpleasant scene the journalists decided not to write about it because we had been invited to the training ground to cover a far more important subject and, when you have sat with men as noble as Charlton, Foulkes, Albert Scanlon, Harry Gregg and Kenny Morgans and seen the hurt in their eyes, it felt incongruous to veer off-track.\",\n",

       "   {'Comment Body': 'Answer: Some great responses here but just want to simplify for folks who may not be aware of how the football world works and just want a high-level understanding of the scenario.\\n\\nRonaldo played at Manchester United from 2003-2009 and is considered a legend of the club (aka team). He eventually left to play in other leagues  - but has always been revered by United fans and is considered one of the GOATs (greatest of all time) in football.\\n\\nRonaldo is 37. Well above the average age of an elite footballer. But he still plays well - just not as well as he used to. Last year, he expressed that he’d like to leave the club he’d been playing for and join a new one. Worth noting he’d been underperforming at that club as well.\\n\\nAfter rumors started swirling that he was considering a move to United’s rival club, United swept in and signed him seemingly overnight. Most United fans were very excited. Others were skeptical due to his age and increasingly poor attitude.\\n\\nRonaldo was being paid £500k a week at United (a very high wage even by football standards), but did not play in many important games and was rarely a starter. He often sat on the bench and came on as a sub for other players. He has shown a poor attitude both on the pitch and in the locker rooms toward other players and especially toward United’s new manager (aka coach).\\n\\nHe made it clear earlier in the year that he wanted to leave United, but no other club wanted him due to his massively high salary, degradation in skill, and general negative attitude.\\n\\nHe went on Piers Morgan to express his disdain for the club, its owners (to be fair, no one likes the owners), the state of the stadium (everyone agrees it’s in need of massive improvements), the manager, and more. Most people think he did this intentionally to get out of his contract. Either way, he and United “parted ways” earlier today. United did not have to pay any money to terminate the contract and he’s now free to go elsewhere.\\n\\nMany United fans are very happy because this means the club now has freed up money to put toward bringing in new players. \\n\\nAdditionally, it was announced today that the Glazers (the aforementioned owners who have been hated and protested by United fans for years), announced they’re open to selling the club. Some are seeing the Ronaldo failure as playing a part in that decision.',\n",

       "   {'Comment Body': \"Answer: Although he did criticize the owners, he didn't just leave it at that. He was dismissive and said he doesn't respect Eric Ten Hag (current Manchester United manager). This is a big deal seeing as how this coach was appointed over the summer to slowly turn things around at a struggling United. The coach has been making slow but steady improvements to the team. \\n\\nOne thing that has been noticeable from the team under the new manager was how well they played when Ronaldo was not in the team. This is almost indisputable really, but from the statements Ronaldo gave in the interview it seems he does not believe this, and thinks he should still be the focal point of the team. \\n\\nDuring the interview he did criticize the owners which is a valid point among Manchester Untied fans, who have been protesting the owners at various games and throughout the last few seasons. Despite maybe resonating with the fans, this may have rubbed the owners the wrong way. \\n\\nAdditionally this interview is really the (admittedly big) tip of the iceberg of his recent actions at the club. \\n\\n* After last season and before the preseason, he publicly said that he wanted to leave. The manager said he wanted to keep him, and also no viable offers came in for him that would allow him to leave. So he was still a Man Utd player.\\n* During preseason he and 7 other players left a friendly preparation game early (i.e. before the game ended), this is not usual. It is also extremely dismissive of a new coach. The players were not punished for this but the manager did say he does not approve.\\n* During a game in which United were 2-0 up against Tottenham the manager wanted to bring on Ronaldo from the bench with 5-6 mins to go and he refused and walked off the pitch. The coach punished him for this.\\n\\nThere is probably a more refined list but these are the main points that led us to him being fired. They say mutual termination but it really is more of a firing.\",\n",

With this World Cup win, I don't think Messi is any better than Ronaldo overall, but maybe I can state that he had a slightly more succesful career, but only by a small margin, really. That 7 Ballon D'Ors and the WC win with Argentina makes that small difference, but this is not to say that Ronaldo's career is not one of the most remarkable ones either.

People are letting the hype of the World Cup plague the reality of the comparison between the two players. I’m not saying one is better than the other. \\n\\nRonaldo absolutely dominated every single league he played in, broke and then set utterly insane scoring records. He holds every single scoring record in the history of the UCL. He did a “threepeat” in the UCL. He played in Spain, Italy, and most importantly, the most difficult and most demanding league in the  English Premier League. He won the Euro’s. When he plays internationals he competes against the top teams in the world. He could score anywhere inside 30 yards with either feet and is absolutely lethal in the air. He is also an unreal athlete. \\n\\nMessi grew up in a softer league than what Ronaldo grew up in. He walked into a system built specifically for him, playing with players he played with since he was young, and was absolutely spoiled by two of the greatest midfielders in Xavi and Iniesta for years. As soon as Ronaldo hit Spain it wasn’t such a cake walk for Messi anymore. He plays for objectively the best or second best team in South America. The quality of players he has around him is always higher and the level of competition is always lower for Messi than it has been for Ronaldo at the international level. When Messi went to France, a league so soft it’s considered a “Farmer’s League” he struggled to dominate there. He’s also not as two-footed and is half the athlete that Ronaldo is. \\n\\nRonaldo is statistically the greatest goal scoring player of all time. Messi is the media’s golden boy and has always had favorable narratives working for him. Ronaldo is not likable no doubt, but he has irrefutably played a more challenging career. Messi never played in the top league and took a step down when he went to France. Ronaldo started in the greatest league of all time, went to Spain, and then Italy.  \\n\\nI say all this to educate the angsty teenagers who are using the hype of the World Cup and their dislike for Ronaldo off the pitch to alter the reality of the comparison. We’ll never see a player like Messi, or Ronaldo again. Messi is a footballing genius of the absolute highest caliber and has broken and set some incredible records himself.

After that he should have kept his head down and understood it would probably be for the best rn to start from the bench for United while trying to get in-form, but instead he decided to think the whole world is against him and do the Piers interview right before the World Cup. He put too much pressure and attention on himself with that move and then you\\'d have his sisters and other public figures go onto social media to talk about how \"ungrateful\" the Portuguese are just because we had the audacity to say he shouldn\\'t be starting rn. Didn\\'t help that the news would just keep focusing on the Ronaldo controversy here. For as much as he has been making an ass of himself I still feel sorry tho, hated seeing him cry at the end of the game yesterday and just didn\\'t like seeing him so ineffective in the World Cup, hopefully he can find a second wind and get back in form by working harder and being more humble regarding his status as a potential bench player. He\\'ll always be the GOAT when it comes to Portugal. \\n\\nTLDR: Think he should have been smarter regarding the way he handled his MUTD problems, a lot of Portuguese people expressed that he should be in the bench, hopefully he can still end his career on a high as he well deserves',\n",

       "   {'Comment Body': \"Full article:\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo will play for Al-Nassr from January 1. The contract that links the Portuguese footballer with the Saudi team will last two and a half seasons, as announced last week. The striker ended his relationship with Manchester United two days before starting his participation in the World Cup in Qatar, being able to negotiate with any team, being Al-Nassr the one that showed more interest from the beginning.\\n\\nThe contract, in addition to the hefty fee (just under one hundred million euros) is surrounded by economic incentives via advertising, which will place the Portuguese as the highest paid athlete in the world. The total amount of CR7's contract with Al-Nassr will be close to 200 million euros per season.\\n\\nMessi, Neymar at PSG are the heads of the soccer cartel, but their 75 and 70 million that they charge per season fall far short of what Cristiano Ronaldo will receive in Saudi Arabia. Even going through the list of the highest paid in the United States, they all fall far short of the money promised to the Portuguese.\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo will find himself in a team that is looking to regain its lost dominance in its competition, far from the world's top level. The step backwards he is taking in sporting terms is evident, but his soccer is gradually placing him at another competitive level. They are even receiving criticism in Portugal for their performance during the World Cup, something unthinkable months ago.\\n\\nIn Al-Nassr he will be coached by the Frenchman Rudi Garcia and will have the Cantabrian Alvaro Gonzalez as a teammate. The central defender arrived in Saudi soccer last summer after finishing his time in France. The presence of Ospina also stands out. The Colombian goalkeeper finished his contract with Napoli and decided to accept the Saudi proposal. Real Madrid had him in the orbit as long as Lunin had left the white discipline, something that did not happen.\",\n",

       "   {'Comment Body': 'Translation by Deepl\\n\\nAnd Manchester United took all away. This sentence sums up what could have been the end of the most fruitful relationship ever between an agent and a Portuguese footballer. It was mid-November last year when, against Jorge Mendes\\' wishes, Cristiano Ronaldo made his divorce from the English club irreversible by giving journalist Piers Morgan an interview that was purposely offensive to the manager, the structure and even the cook. Mendes had been searching for months for an elite team that would accept Cristiano and he knew there was only one: Manchester United. Once that door was closed, no other would open.\\n\\nRonaldo and Mendes had been disagreeing about what was to come for some time. The latter had a good feel for the market when Cristiano and Juventus wanted to part company. The former would not accept a secondary role or a smaller stage than the Champions League.\\n\\nAlready at Old Trafford, the departure of former Manchester United colleague Solskjaer, and the entry of German Ralf Rangnick (whom, in the interview, Ronaldo disregarded, calling him sporting director), accelerated the shock with reality and also the frequency of Cristiano\\'s bad behaviours, most of them never made public, but always grounds for complaint from United to Jorge Mendes.\\n\\nStill, there was in Rangnick a bonhomie of which the successor Ten Hag is not a fan. Faced with the same reluctance from Ronaldo to accept the coach\\'s autonomy, the Dutchman reacted harshly, in and out. Too much for Cristiano.\\n\\nAround that time, it was still Jorge Mendes who threw in the only alternative (Al-Nassr) that married most of his player\\'s demands, but when he blew the bridge with Manchester United, it wasn\\'t in Arabia that Cristiano was thinking. Mendes was wrong. Despite no pre-season, despite a meagre six first-team appearances since September, despite a record of three goals, Ronaldo would make a legendary World Cup and Europe would fall at his feet once again.\\n\\nInstead, he arrived in Qatar with normal performance for a 38-year-old with no pace and, worse than that, replicating Manchester\\'s behaviour. Players and FPF hushed it up almost, but the captain was a constant focus of irritation, particularly after Portugal-South Korea and accelerating quickly to inflammatory after Uruguay-Portugal. Around that time, the third figure in the triumvirate, Ricardo Regufe, comes on the scene.\\n\\nRegufe started out as Nike\\'s representative in Portugal perhaps twenty years ago and in that capacity did logistical support for the brand on both the national team and Ronaldo. With time, less and less to the first and more and more to the second, until he became a full time member of the player\\'s staff, without abandoning the training sessions and trips of the national team, strangeness that was less indifferent to some colleagues than to others.\\n\\nThere have also been a number of antibodies between Gestifute, Mendes\\' company, and Regufe. Although the agent has always continued with a direct line to Cristiano, the other elements of the company (Polaris, for example) began to deal only with the right-hand man. Curiously, even if they have effectively ceased the services of sports representation of Mendes, Polaris Sports, also of Gestifute, was still responsible for the management of Ronaldo\\'s image rights. At least until this Tuesday.\\n\\nAfter missing the World Cup, and despite the \"many opportunities in Europe, Brazil, Australia, the United States and even Portugal\", Ronaldo\\'s first act was to instruct Ricardo Regufe to contact Al-Nassr to find out if the interest communicated in November by Jorge Mendes still existed. There is no news, however, of proposals from Europe and those from Portugal are difficult to conceive, for various reasons, but perhaps FC Porto, Sporting or Benfica can shed some light on their part, assuming it was one of the big boys who was interested in bringing Ronaldo back to a league he had only known through the ranks.\\n\\nThe presentation by Al-Nassr, in the tones in which they did it, and Cristiano\\'s statement that there was nothing else to conquer in Europe, definitely closes, and in the worst way, the Mendes-Ronaldo partnership. What they did was not, 100%, an innovation. Beckham had already walked the paths of the superstar (he is still the fourth most followed footballer on social networks, 10 years after his retirement), but in terms of scale and planning, this marriage surpassed everything. But even the best planning has limits. In the offices of Gestifute, some have long said that Ronaldo would end up in the desert.',\n",

This means he stimulates on an almost daily basis ALL the muscle fibers in his legs, not only type I (which runners focus on) or type II (which lifters focus on). And the legs respond really well to both types of exercises because they have a fairly good amount of every type of fiber. On top of that, his BMR is insane due to the amount of physical exercise his been doing for many, many years, and his metabolism is shifted to work on very low amounts of body fat. Every person has a body fat percentage range that the body is comfortable with and tries to maintain it. With a low BF, you can see the muscle striations and they do look bigger and more impressive than they are.

Rooney for example , will come trash talking CR7 anytime he has the opportunity, Casillas on his time was telling to his ex wife Sara that “CR7 is a selfish player and only thinks for himself”. \\n- His attitude when he was sub off or at bench with Ten Hag. Literally he was been a drama queen rather than been a professional and work his way. He left before the match was finished when he was sub off lmao. Even Allegri mentioned that it was a waste of money to bring CR7 to Juve cuz he made other players worst and now everyone have to played for him. \\n- The narrative that the team always plays for him and that he is the team.

I say 2013 cuz thats the year i first ever read shouts of him being the best in the world. By 2012 Messi was already getting called the best in history. As the media catalyzed this rivalry into what we know today, Ronaldo became egotistical and talked down on anyone who said he was 2nd or 3rd. His attitude is not suitable for a rolemodel and quite frankly his fans make it worse. His fans downgrade Messi's achievements and exaggerate Ronaldo's which can be annoying. It is unfair to Ronaldo to receive the hate that he does but it is his own fans doing. Not to mention how Ronaldo has always been a hypocrite when it came to Messi and interviews in which he would talk shit about Messi when Messi has yet to make a hateful comment about Ronaldo. His fans also consist of United, Madrid, and Portuguese supporters. Madrid having the biggest fanbase for any football club ever, they created a mob mentality. I have not heard any fan from other football clubs that I’ve mentioned say Ronaldo is the best ever\",\n",

He only ever loved himself. He had no issue using United name to press Madrid into solving his taxes issues or getting a new fatty contract showing that deep down he was just using both clubs for his personal gains. \\n\\nPeople before were able to endure this or even ignore it completely because he was pretty damn good at football and he couldn't stop scoring and winning his clubs trophies. Now that he's washed out and he's becoming a hindrance to his team rather than help, you are left with him as a person and as I said above, he's an arrogant, self centered bastard.\\n\\nHe is a legend of sport and Real Madrid and one of the best players to ever exist, but he deserves such ending as well. Ironically, his arrogance and self centered mindset were the biggest reasons of his downfall. If he had realized he was washed out and can no longer be the main man, be content with a bench role and being role model for youngsters in United and playing the leader personality in the dressing room even while not playing much, he could have stayed at United and ended his career in a more respectable manner, but as we said, being egotistical maniac made him believe he could still play at the top and it was United's fault. He ruined the end of his career by his own hands. A well deserved end to be totally honest.\\n\\nFinally, look at Zlatan and how he managed the last few years of his career. Guy is arrogant outside the pitch alright, but on the pitch he realized he can no longer play constantly or be the main man all the time and that helped extend his career with Milan till winning the league with them. He was a role model in the dressing room and a true leader even while not playing as much as he used to, then compare this with what Ronaldo did with United.\",\n",

He could have terminated his contract with Manchester United in a private manner, but instead, his ego led him to give a public interview with Piers Morgan, which negatively affected his reputation. Just a few years ago, [Ronaldo stated that we wouldn\\'t see him play in Middle Eastern countries like Qatar](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A1lzMRTFVUs) ([and here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HgC-sh-TGCA)), but in the end, he lied and chose money over passion. Now, he is making exaggerated claims about the competitiveness of the Saudi League. It\\'s as if he has become David Beckham, who was paid a huge sum of money to be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, and made controversial statements about Qatar just to gain attention and sponsorship for Qatar. I think we can all agree that If Ronaldo had not done the interview with Piers Morgan, and terminated his contract with Man United in a private manner, he could have gone to Sporting or even Arsenal. However, now he is in Saudi Arabia, making a monthly salary of 16.6 million USD and scoring easy goals against clubs that seem to be playing in \"Beginner Mode in FIFA\"\\n\\nRonaldo ain\\'t always been the \"bad guy\" in the eyes of the media compared to Messi.

Cristiano is a visionary, he knows Europe is becoming a whore to sponsorships and money so why not go to place which is richer than Europe itself? A state backed project worth 700billion and projected to cross 1000b by 2030? He will soon own clubs and become a multi billionaire he is a hustler, He won everything there is to the game and gave us 4 UCL titles, 450 goals. What more do you want? He cost less than Hazard and Jovic too. Some players who have the tech can be egotistical thats what makes them a galactico dont forget. We are not a soulless machine club like Varca or City, we embrace fights, emotion and passion.

Messi vs Ronaldo, Barça vs Real Madrid... polar opposities in character too. I think the media will spend the coming decades trying to create something similar, but nothing will quite resemble this. \\n\\nThe biggest shame of Ronaldo's career was leaving Real Madrid. His numbers were good at Juve, but that was about it. His return to Manchester United ended dramatically and that was that. He *did* stop at his peak, because in the 17/18 season he was already being rested for the biggest games and he lifted that 3rd CL in a row, but then, when you see the likes of Casemiro, Modric & Kroos there in 21/22 with another CL and his numbers at Juve, I think Ronaldo could've definitely been a part of that as well. \\n\\nAll in all, his departure and Hazard's flop opened the door wide open for Vinicius and Benzema in some way.\",\n",

For me, it was a source of pride the numbers I achieved. But I want more, as long as I play, the bar has to be set high, thinking big. I thank those who helped me, in clubs and national teams. Hatred? I don\\'t see things that way, the rivalry is over. It was good, the spectators liked it. Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don\\'t have to hate Messi. They are both very good, they changed the history of football. We are respected all over the world, that\\'s the most important thing. He goes his way, I go mine. He has been doing well, from what I\\'ve seen. It\\'s about continuing, the legacy continues, I don\\'t see the rivalry that way. I\\'ve even said, we shared the stage for 15 years and ended up being, I won\\'t say friends, but we are colleagues and respect each other.\"\\n\\n  \\nWorld football and Saudi Arabia: \"It\\'s normal to criticize, which league isn\\'t criticized? Where are there no problems and controversies? They exist everywhere. Spain, Portugal... I already knew, I keep saying, everyone thought I was crazy, but the crazy one isn\\'t that crazy... Playing in the Arab league is normal now. As a player for Al Nassr, I knew this would happen, it\\'s a privilege to change a country\\'s culture and football, to have great players, and it makes me proud. I was the pioneer and I\\'m proud of it. What I want most is to continue evolving, to stay at the top.\"\\n\\n  \\nIs the national team better now than in 2003? \"Neither better nor worse, it\\'s a different phase. When there\\'s a change, you breathe differently without disregarding the work that has been done in recent years. Since 2003, there have been good moments, final stages, World Cups and European Championships, Nations League, these are normal phases that national teams go through. This moment has been very good, in my opinion. In training, it feels different, in training and games, we all win. We are happy about it, especially me, I am happy, everything has gone well, I have scored. I want to continue, I feel good, useful. The 20-year mark makes me proud because it shows longevity, it\\'s difficult, but I have shown that it\\'s possible.\"\\n\\n  \\nLast game against Slovakia and a goal. Reaching 900 for the national team? \"I think I scored from a free-kick... 850 were scored now, 860, 870... Slowly, not rushing too much. As long as I play, my goal is always to look forward and achieve the national team and club objectives, but also my own, enjoy, life is dynamic. Tomorrow is uncertain. The moment is good here and at the club, so I will continue.\"\\n\\n  \\nCancelo and Félix\\'s call-ups to the national team: \"I\\'ll be clear. I\\'ve been here for 20 years, and there hasn\\'t been a call-up without controversy. It will always happen, whether it\\'s with Martínez or Fernando Santos, it will always be the same. What I ask for the most is that regardless of who is there, whoever comes in good form or less experienced, we should support the coach\\'s decisions. We play for the country and the national team, we have to think about the goal of qualifying and support the coach\\'s decisions that he has to make, there will always be controversy, the important thing is to win and support the coach\\'s decisions.\"  \\n\\n\\n  \\n12 goals at Al Nassr... reaching 17 or more: \"It wouldn\\'t be bad. I think I\\'ve accustomed people to such a high number that 10, 15, 17 seems like not much. It\\'s what I\\'ve set as the standard, what I want most is to keep going. I feel good, I\\'ve done good work, a good preseason, also with the national team. I think I will score more than 17 this year. I have that confidence because I started really well. The preseason was key, I had never had such a good one. I hope to hold up as much as possible during the season. There\\'s always a drop in form; I hope it happens naturally. I want to be there when they need me. Keep this positive momentum going.\"\\n\\n  \\nStaying for the World Cup? \"I\\'ll be very honest. Nowadays, in the last two years, I think differently. Things have happened that made me realize that life has to be about the moment. I can no longer think long-term. Anything can happen, something can change everything. Enjoy the moment, it\\'s good. I aim to go to the European Championship and have an excellent European Championship. Everything else, we\\'ll see. Life is dynamic and you never know what might happen. It\\'s \\'Enjoy the Moment\\'.\"\\n\\n  \\nControversies in Portuguese football: \"Honestly, it doesn\\'t surprise me. Controversy exists in all leagues, but in Portugal, there has been a lot of controversy. It\\'s bad. People with a minimum level of intelligence know that. But everyone is looking out for their own interests. It\\'s as it should be, it doesn\\'t surprise me. It\\'s a rough patch, but I hope it gets fixed. I opened a newspaper a little while ago to see what was going on, and the first three news items were unrelated to football. It makes us think and realize that the most important thing is bad news. I\\'m Portuguese, it worries me because I\\'d like it to be top-notch, but it won\\'t be, and it isn\\'t. One of the problems is that everyone has an opinion, everyone is debating, 40 channels talking and debating. That\\'s bad, very bad. That\\'s why it won\\'t be top-notch in the near future, like the Premier League, La Liga, or the Bundesliga. I thought it could enter the top 4 or 5, but I don\\'t believe it now. I believe the Arabian league is better than the Portuguese league. It\\'s not just the controversies; there\\'s not as much noise, and the quality of names is much better. I hope it can improve, I know it will be difficult, possibly impossible. What has happened in recent times has become a circus.\"',\n",
