Its something to look out for albeit not be sure of. Personal anecdotes lmao. Do you truly wanna act like this is not supported by data? Once again not a rule of law but a tendency applying to a significant share of minority populations in varying degrees: There is a very clear tendency of minority populations fostering communities with each other in foreign countries. Like their own churches, sporting clubs, restaurants/bars, little markets delivering home country goods whole city districts sometimes even. All of these places are typical places for them to socalize specifically with each other. This is reflected in social circles too. You can often see a clear bias towards their own in their friend circles compared to what the local distribution actually looks like. A minority might consitute only 2 % of the local population but the friend circle could be closer to 30-50%.

f0rsakeN and something lost to a GE player,General Discussion,"There have been hundreds of games like this? SkRossi has beaten Forsaken and Jingg, has clips against them, forsaken has beaten SkRossi and lightningfast before and has clips against him. It's ranked bro. Pros play it after a long day of practice in scrims and whatnot to develop their mechanics. Of course, they try to a great extent in ranked games but it's nothing too special. These games happen a dozen times every week. Do not understand why you would need to make a thread out of it. Moreover, Lightningfast is not a bad player, like he is literally signed to a franchised team. He can at least compete against other franchised players in the APAC league and something has not even played a T1 game yet. He has been farming in the JP scene just like SkRossi was farming stats in India for 2 years and against teams like Fennel and still lost (which even the old GE could beat during APAC LCQ in 2021). Sure he has potential but how does that make him any different to other small-league farmers like SkRossi, Wronski or similar players?",India,7,14/3/2023,3:26,14/3/2023,2:45
f0rsakeN and something lost to a GE player,General Discussion,I was mostly talking about sg something. Since he's really good mechanically and some of the insane flicks I've seen are by him. He has 300acs and 200ADR but i was just checking how he performs against GE players. Basically I want to see how he will perform against T1 teams.,India,-8,14/3/2023,3:32,14/3/2023,2:45
f0rsakeN and something lost to a GE player,General Discussion,"So what? Remember when SkRossi had the highest ACS in the world, and Deathmaker and RvK were right behind him? He was no.1 player for a good 5-6 months on VLR according to stats. And mind you, without Crazy Racoons, Zeta and players like Meteorite and Xnfri out of their league, JP league is even worse than South Asia league in 2022. I bet Kappa could become a decent initiator in that league. It's hard to judge a player like this. Maybe something really has some crazy potential and will go insane in the franchised league if he gets signed. Or maybe he will not be as good like a lot of Turkish, Brazilian and Indian players that get overhyped. What is worse is that you think one game of ranked is enough data for you to measure is abilities. Its like you have smoked horse shit or something.",India,7,14/3/2023,3:44,14/3/2023,2:45

Riot needs to do something about the BR community,General Discussion,"tbh neither deserve it. Nobody deserves death threats. What I think vyltx is trying to say, but not well. Is how one got it because they played a match and riot fucked up. The other got it because they're involved in fights on twitter.

Riot needs to do something about the BR community,General Discussion,"the thing is, if nobody gets punished for this, it wont stop. It wasn't that long ago when hiko had to hire bodyguards in brazil because of the hate he got. It was only like 2 years ago where leaf, a 16 year old received death threats. Even 3 months ago asuna received them. Now I'm not saying what zombs said is fine. He'll most likely receive a fine, and possible suspension by riot. There's a chance for that. I just hope he isn't made to sit out of the event, because then we wouldn't see sentinels perform at their peak. I'd rather him get a punishment after the event, than before. riot also need to sort their rulings out. Breaking momentum with furia, is unfortunate. We dont know if they'd have won with it, or not. However we'll never know. Their ruling with Vk, although they were playing better, and were the better team. They should have to ff the map like giants, and x10 did.

something > f0rsaken,General Discussion,"This is just my opinion, while something looks to be the better player mechanically and has a lot more impact, I still think forsaken is a better player (overall in my eyes) just because he can play all the roles and agents when his team needs it. His Raze debut in Madrid still impressed me because he literally just picked it up and went nuts that game. Something's willingness to be aggressive yielded a lot of success, but at the same time if he gets punished for it that's one valuable player down. From what I see, forsaken has been playing way more safe, letting Jinggg and something take the frags, but you can't really blame him for being more of a team player to support his teammates for success. Every player on prx plays their part to contribute to their success, we can go all day arguing who's better than who, but ultimately we can just all agree they're a a team of cracked players who are very fun and heart attack inducing to watch (trolling optional)",Singapore,7,13/5/2024,13:40,13/5/2024,13:23
something > f0rsaken,General Discussion,"if someone is playing better valorant then someone else then imo theyre just the better player. You can flex as much as you want but you actually have to be outperforming players who aren't to be considered better than them. Demon1 on smokes was only crazy as it was last year not because he was flexing a weird role as a duelist, it was crazy because he was literally the best smokes of the tourney. I feel like a lot of these takes stem from the fact that something just has a lot more competition for his role compared to f0rsaken who only has Chronicle. It's easy to say that f0rsaken is better than something if we compare them to the top players in the roles they play (like aspas > something), but that shouldn't be the case. For example, visualize Chronicle playing for PRX over f0rsaken, would you consider him to be better than something or worse? Chronicle has been just as much as a flex as f0rsaken with better stats the past two years + three titles (although one of them is kek//in), but I feel like a lot of people would still say something is the better player if they played on the same team.",United States,-4,13/5/2024,14:03,13/5/2024,13:23

For me it's actually the other way around, instead of comparing with others, let's say, you would want to build a super team, and you can only choose forsaken as the flex OR something as the duelist for the team (ignoring the fact that most people would build a team without these two), who would you pick? I would say I would rather pick forsaken just because his versatility compared to other players, and the ability to perform at such a high level, is very near unmatched.

In the same vein, F0rsaken has mainly been playing a support role. He's been setting up kills for Jinggg and Something in Lotus especially on Breach. The fact that he is so flexible with agents also allows the whole team to play different or unorthodox comps. Thinking that fragging / ""carrying"" = best player is quite shallow imo, it is natural for a duelist to have more freedom in taking duels.

There is a BIG difference between a good duelist and a jett abuser If he is a good duelist, he needs to be good with raze. heat? not good with raze aspas? not good with raze xand? not good with raze tenz? not good with raze cned? not good with raze scream? not good with raze d3ffo? not good with raze derke? not good with raze Thats why I think he is undoubtely the best player in the world. If RIOT by any means decides to nerf jett and shift the meta we prolly not gonna even hear names like cned and tenz again :> He is not killing 40+ per map because when he joined VK he was forced to play a different role because heat is already a main jett... and lets be honest, every single duelist nowadays gets 20+ kills per map because team and setups are basically built around you (even steel managed to get 20 kills with it",China,0,7/3/2025,20:11,7/3/2025,10:03

EMEA COME,General Discussion,Why is it so hard for you to grasp the idea that people can and will support players outside of their country/race/religion/color? Why do you even support LOUD or their players when they dont even know u exist - why not support people only in your MonkeySphere (people u know and talk to on a daily basis -)?

EMEA COME,General Discussion,"First: People can do that, but it seems like they don't like to admit that they do it because they don't have any other choice. Especially Europeans. It's not like a Spaniard wakes up and thinks, ""what a lovely day, today I'm going to root for my country's team in Valorant/LOL/CS (whatever)."" They simply don't have that alternative and, due to this circumstance, they are led to root for a region (EMEA) with foreign players from several different countries. This is not an opinion, it's just a hard truth to swallow. But gradually, they will be able to overcome this. Second: I root for Loud not because they are Brazilian, since Furia and Mibr are also Brazilian teams and I don't root for them. I root for IDENTIFICATION.

EMEA COME,General Discussion,"It's not about xenophobia, it's about different emotions: rooting for 5 people from your own country is different from rooting for 5 foreigners from different countries, but who are from the same continent. For example, the feeling of rooting for Sentinels is not the same as before, according to some Americans. When 2k and Tarik joined to complete a team that was previously composed of 5 Brazilians, many began to not care if the team lost - it wasn't like before. I see many Europeans pretending not to care about it by saying that we are nationalists, but this argument seems to be used as a facade for the lack of a team to be ""nationalistic"" about.",Brazil,-14,3/5/2023,3:18,3/5/2023,2:17

There are plenty of people that do care and definitely would feel stronger in rooting for a team composed of their country men. But this isn't everyone. A lot of people simply don't have an ounce of nationalism in them. That might be hard to understand for a Brazilian as that definitely doesn't seem to be the case for most people in Brazil, but there are plenty of people that feel that way. You can pretend that's a facade if you want. For some people, I'm sure it is. But it isn't for others. Acting as if you can magically get in everyone's head and know exactly how they feel/think is pretty arrogant and quite frankly makes you come off as pretty delusional.",Nigeria,4,3/5/2023,6:50,3/5/2023,2:17

Zero World Cups. ""if that was the case why doesnt your current squad just field BR club players - or are they not as good as the ones who go to EU clubs?"" Currently, the situation is different, and it's not just about money anymore, but because the best players are in Europe. Even if the MLS paid more than European teams, the average American player wouldn't refuse an offer from Chelsea to play in the Premier League, for example. Competitiveness > money. That's why few players go to China, despite them paying on average much more than European teams. ""How do Brazilians win so many club trophies in EU?"" I didn't understand that point, the Brazilian goes to any team aiming for titles... He can be bad and still win a Champions League, the quality of a single player doesn't define the result. ""Why cant u accept the fact that EU is not xenophobic enough to accept BR players and train them and give them money?"" It's not like Europe is doing us a favor by hiring someone. They buy our players because in Brazil we have a good crop for any position on the field, and so they seek to have better results in their respective leagues. Brazilian players accept because most of the time the salary is satisfactory and they will have chances to play against the bests. It's a two-way street, everyone wins.

That place you were born in you did not choose. You did not choose Brazil just like someone from America didn’t choose America. You didn’t not choose poverty or wealth just like you did not choose a war torn land over a prosperous land. It’s prideful to associate yourself with that, weak and makes you hard hearted. It’s weak minded and obtuse to assume something about someone based off of their appearance. Yes, some cultures are inherently better than others, if they benefit, instead of being delusional and continuing something based off of pride and for the sake of continuing something. It’s like nationalism is all you have. (Culture that is good :food, clothing, anything that doesn’t divide us humans based off of certain customs.) Race is a social construct, yes, it only divides and creates animosity, we have different face shapes, features, that are all used to differentiate and identify, not to place more or less value, except to create communities and segregate us. But choosing to desegregate is also not inherently bad, except that you may feel like an outsider, so having your own people is good, you feel apart of something, but the moment you hate and discriminate based only of color, and ethnicity, is the moment you have become ignorant prideful, and arrogant. You should discriminate , Yes!, but only based off of morals, good character, and trustworthiness, based off of religious piety (how much he fears God, this does not apply if you are atheist and polytheist, but you will see a difference between the one who is pious and not.)

EMEA COME,General Discussion,"Cheering for teams with players from the same country creates a sense of community and identity among fans, which makes the experience exciting in itself. People come together around a common goal, which can increase the sense of belonging and unity. It's fun to cheer for a team that represents your culture and traditions, with players that you can identify with and share values through the same language. There is a sense of responsibility and pride, which may not exist in other cases (such as the one mentioned in my question). There's nothing wrong with these feelings and experiences described above. It has nothing to do with nationalism, which is a political ideology. It's a feeling that we can, perhaps, correlate with patriotism. Brazil is a multiracial country, just like the origin of the players who represent Loud/FURIA/Mibr, which is already a clear evidence that Brazilian fans rooting for Brazilian teams has nothing to do with race/ethnicity, as you suggested. My point is: rooting for teams with players who have no connection to you (as a fan) MAY (that's why I asked) make the experience less engaging and exciting because there is no social identity relationship that can be observed in teams with opposite characteristics, making everything much less thrilling. You have confused nationalism (an ideology) with nationality (the condition or status of belonging to a certain region).

if PRX disband,General Discussion,"Looking at just pure ratings is not the only indicator whether a player is gonna get offers though? Most IGLs have shit rating yet they get alot of offers because they provide a different set of skills and value to the team compare to fraggers like Something / Aspas. Forsaken in this case provides most teams across the world flexibility and innovations in how agents like Yoru or harbour can be played at the highest level, while still being able to frag really well when needed. Edit: is something gonna get some crazy maybe even record breaking offer? Yea i believe he can and probably will in the off chance PRX disbands either now or in the future when he gets even better. Is he gonna get the most offers though? Not exactly, since many teams already have a set core / star fragger in their team, switching the entire team chemistry out and trying to rebuild ( not knowing whether it will pay off) is not worth the risk for those teams that have already settled, hence why forsaken may receive the MOST offers, not the highest paid offer but the MOST offers from teams, since his skillset provides an upgrade to most players while not disrupting the team playstyle / chemistry due to how flexible he can be while still performing at a pretty high level",Malaysia,2,18/4/2024,22:29,17/4/2024,4:37

Joining as a 6th man on PRX tho, is not really the best of ideas, since he's probably never playing, Davai is their initiator and I don't see him replacing Jingg nor f0rsaken who have proved so much in the past 18 months.

New Korean Superstar Something 2.0,General Discussion,Problem is when Stew gets tilted he can't pull it back together.

Why Something is considered an Import,General Discussion,Some people were confused about this so I wanted to clear things up. Something originates from the far east of Russia from a town named Vladivostok which is considered to be part of Asian side of Russia. Which means that technically something is an Asian. He is still considered to be an import because Riot has classified any Russian to be part of EMEA wether they are from the European or Asian side. This is also why he was always playing in Japanese challengers because Tokyo servers are closer to him then Moscow servers.,United States,12,17/8/2023,10:08,17/8/2023,10:08

Was his util that bad causing all this hate? I mean he just started going full time initiator.",United States,0,24/3/2025,1:01,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,idk i was watching drx most the time but i dont think there was anything wrong with the util? just bad midrounding and getting outcalled and outlurked by mako tbh,Australia,0,24/3/2025,1:04,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"interesting, I need to watch the games myself but just seeing thread I thought he had a abysmal performance based on what people were saying",United States,0,24/3/2025,1:07,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,yes. honestly i like the changes they made to the roles it actually looks good on paper. jingg especially looked a lot better then i thought he would on smokes. but yeah somethings utility is just non existent. if you want an example go watch round 15 icebox that was so bad i wont forget it for a long time. it makes the patmen pick up make a lot of sense too whoever the weak link is on their new role is getting cut and from first game i would say its something.,Canada,2,24/3/2025,1:06,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"Just watched that one round, my thought is, is that Something fault? or just a miscall by PRX? was he supposed to drone and they all ran out before it? did they just call for no drone? I don't necessarily think its just something fault there.",United States,0,24/3/2025,1:11,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,ok your not wrong the entire team their is just like wtf are you guys doing but personally as a sova player if my team is taking b main there is zero chance im not droning b main. they maybe called for him not to drone and if thats the case alecks needs to sit that guy down and tell him to stfu. but regardless that one was just what popped into my head their were plenty of times where somethings utility was late and it just left f0rsaken on an island. id have to rewatch the game to pull rounds tho.,Canada,0,24/3/2025,1:16,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"I see, when I watch later I will probably see what you are talking about.",United States,0,24/3/2025,1:17,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"Yeah, Patmen as Sova-Breach-Tejo would be a good option while Jingg can go back to Raze (in Raze map) Double duelist: Jinggg and F0rsaken Double initiator: D4v4i and Patmen (even triple controller with Jinggg play Tejo) Double controller: D4v4i and Jinggg or D4v4i and Mindfreak",Cambodia,1,24/3/2025,1:13,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,yeah that would make a lot of sense. but something might get better being full time initiator give him a bit of time.,Canada,0,24/3/2025,1:20,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"He has always played Breach since 2023 on Fracture. Also, giving him more time in a tight schedule risks the team not qualifying again for the International",Cambodia,0,24/3/2025,1:24,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,map 1 Haven is great entertainment. Don't look at who won the rounds on VLR tho.,International,0,24/3/2025,1:07,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"Yes, his utility usage and timing is bad. Let's say if G2 without Trent/JonahP His teammate need initiator utility for info and flash, not for his own benefit to kill like what he did with Reyna flash. His mindset is not into assisting teammate but to flash and kill people with his own weapon",Cambodia,3,24/3/2025,1:07,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"Yeah he's flashing for himself instead of team constantly on Breach which is pure troll, agent is specifically designed to punish you doing that and yet here we are. Hes 100% getting cut for Patmen unless theyve plans for a 6 man roster.",United Kingdom,0,24/3/2025,1:12,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"True, the only option for him is play ISO and F0rsaken play Sova/Breach. But Iso as single duelist is kinda tricky and easy to countered, so people would choose double duelist Iso-Yoru",Cambodia,0,24/3/2025,1:15,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,Better on Duelist.,Europe,0,24/3/2025,1:09,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,they got lurked every time. not the problem with something. comp is heavy attack. also lack of game sense and fundamentals like they always rotate giving all the sounds or try to clear area by one person. their attack pretty good,Sri Lanka,-1,24/3/2025,1:12,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"The cope here is they're still adjusting into their new roles, because on paper the role swap makes total sense.",International,0,24/3/2025,1:13,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"For Jingg and Mindfreak, not Something",Cambodia,0,24/3/2025,1:22,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,Something: Alot of people shit talked his sova there were some bad moment but overall he was decent the bad thing was breach his util was either late or missed he had some decent flashes but he mostly used them for him self. Jinggg: he looked good on tejo but it's a simple agent so not a surprise his omen play is decent but he misplaced some smokes and miss timed a couple but overall was the best next to forsaken D4V4I: probably a hot take but i think he is the weakest link rn he always been a flash initiator player amazing on skye and kayo because he can use his util to make plays but when he is on info initiator he tries to force these plays even tho his util isn't the best for also since champ last year him and something were the most disconnected from the team play something is getting better at it tho,Palestine,0,24/3/2025,1:48,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,yeah davai is stats player. He can't out aim people like flashback. Maybe people glaze him cause he doesn't make stupid mistakes unlike rest of the players in prx. But he is shooting is weak. but idk I thought sacy was the weak link in sen as well. Now sen looks worse compared to last year.,Bangladesh,0,24/3/2025,2:15,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,Surely that's an insane bait right?,France,0,24/3/2025,2:44,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,He get the glaze because he had an insane season during the skye meta and he didn't replcate that season but he still consistent but i agree he probably has the sacy role on the team where he does stuff outside of his gameplay,Palestine,0,24/3/2025,2:45,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,"He might not be the perfect Sova, but his utility wasn’t bad either. The match was lost due to the difference in calling — the gap in mid-rounding was insane. PRX really needs an IGL.",Zimbabwe,0,24/3/2025,2:24,24/3/2025,1:01
PRX Something,General Discussion,Agree his sova isn't as bad as people are saying but his breach didn't look good,Palestine,0,24/3/2025,2:47,24/3/2025,1:01

Once the data's collected scrappy sends that data to the Django backend via a post request which gets processed and saved into a SQLite database. meanwhile I just poll the backend from the frontend with ajax to check if it's done, and if it is done getting the data I just refresh the page and then the data appears there",Pakistan,2,23/11/2023,5:19,22/11/2023,16:01

I have no clue why anyone even brings this up. It's her choice what she does with her body and it shouldn't have any relations to sinatraa. Why people are bringing this up and making assumptions about her based upon this, idk. sinatraa not cooperating with the investigation. Sinatraa got a six month ban for not cooperating with the RIOT investigation, not the federal one. No one knows the reason why he didn't cooperate, so no one should be saying anything about it or making assumptions based upon that. His lawyer could've recommended that he didn't share any evidence with riot for the betterment of his federal case, but all we know is that he didn't cooperate--that's that, we don't know anything behind the scenes. Cleo not continuing with the accusations/federal investigation. If you put yourself in Cleo's situation for 10 seconds you would understand why she did this. That being said however, those are also assumptions and we will never truly know why she didn't continue with the investigation. With how many death threats and how much backlash she was facing, she had a lot to deal with. If I was in her situation I would get tired of dealing with everything and give up. However, we should stop bringing this up because we have no clue why she even did it. The law. Thinking about this pertains to his situation in esports makes sense. However, saying some bullshit like ""innocent until proven guilty"" shouldn't be a backing for your opinion on the situation. You're allowed to think someone is innocent or guilty apart from the law. Yes--its a fair standing when considering his legal situation. But no, it is not a reason for you to support him. Like I said above, people's bases for why sinatraa didn't cooperate with the Riot investigations or why Cleo didn't continue with the federal investigations is all just assumptions, no one really knows anything, therefore it's not a viable reason for your opinions. That all being said, you need to focus on what you DO know about the situation to develop your opinions. That brings me to what you SHOULD consider: the facts and Cleo's document about it. The document provides the facts: the video clip and the screenshots and her speaking about her experience. Watch and read that shit, then develop your opinion about it. That's all I have, I know nobody asked.""]( -----------------------------------",Pakistan,1,1/4/2024,16:55,22/11/2023,16:01

If RIOT by any means decides to nerf jett and shift the meta we prolly not gonna even hear names like cned and tenz again :> He is not killing 40+ per map because when he joined VK he was forced to play a different role because heat is already a main jett... and lets be honest, every single duelist nowadays gets 20+ kills per map because team and setups are basically built around you (even steel managed to get 20 kills with it",Belize,0,6/5/2024,12:52,22/11/2023,16:01

I'm your 4-star no-life host, and today I'm going to be showing you how you can be just as much of a degenerate as me! VLR is very simple. You can start threads to reply to one. If you gain upfrags, that will help you gain stars. If you are downfragged enough, you will start losing stars. The more stars you gain, the more likely you haven't touched grass. Before you start posting, there are a few things we need to do. First, you need to select your country. For this, you have a few options. Firstly, you could simply select the country that you reside in. This is the easiest option. If you want to cosplay as an edgy 12-year-old, set your flag to North Korea. Everyone will find this very funny! If you are not from any European country and you want to get stars easily, make sure to set your flag as any European country. Flairs are the other thing that you can select. Like before, the easiest option is to select the team that you like. However, you may not want to do this. If you want to have stars, make sure to not put on a Sentinels or TSM flair, as everyone will hate on you. If you want to be able to post the most delusional takes possible without being downfragged, a Team Liquid flair will help you do just that. Also, if your team is doing poorly, make sure to bandwagon onto another team and pretend to like them. Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's get to posting! When starting a thread, you will be met with three forum categories. ""General Discussion"" is supposed to be for all things Valorant. ""Off Topic"" is supposed to be for other things, however nobody uses this so you can post whatever off topic thread on General Discussion. Lastly, ""Site Feedback"" is feedback for enigma, the developer of this website. Now if you want easy upgfrags, try some of the these tactics: Start a daily Shahzam hate thread Whenever Sentinels are mentioned, you can reply by saying ""washed"", ""stream team"", ""overrated"", ""garbage"", and other negative adjectives When TSM is mentioned, you can reply by saying ""Tweet Some More"", ""Tweet Solo Mid"", and other similar insults Saying that Hiko should be dropped Making fun of a Brazilian for no reason Making a laugh thread after a team loses (there are some exceptions to this) There are also some things that you want to avoid doing, such as: Arguing with a Team Liquid fan. This will not go well for you. Trust me. Saying that you unironically like TenZ. WE HECKIN LOVE TENZ BatChest Liking Sentinels or TSM Ratioing is a common phenomena observed on VLR. This can be an easy way to gain upfrags without contributing anything, but there are a few things to remember before doing so. Do not ever try to attempt to ratio a site admin or writer. Secondly, only try to ratio of you are the first or one of the first to comment, and especially don't try to ratio if someone has already tried to. Lastly, do not try to ratio a verified user. Oftentimes, if someone has failed a ratio, you can reply by saying ""counter"" or ""counter-ratio"". If someone's counter fails, you can reply by saying :counter denied"". If you witness a successful ratio, make sure to reply with ""assist"" for free upfrags. Copypastas are common, and there are too many to list here. You will find many as you traverse the vast threads of VLR, and you will learn which ones to spam at what time. Lastly, there are some prolific users on this site that you should be aware of. Netero : One of the most active members of the site. Generally well-liked by the community, but also an absolute weeb. ShadowisBAD : You will see this user appear on most large threads. Everyone hates shadow as he is a Sentinels fan, and you will frequently see him being massively downfragged. CalypsoGHC : Another active user. Generally disliked by the community for being a TSM fan and having bad baits (but not as hated as shadow). Also has the record for the most downfragged comment. trembolonaRage : Arguably the most hated user on this site. He is known for being a Brazilian and his extremely delusional takes on mwzera. Noyn : One of the only well-liked Brazilians on the site. Well-known for his high-effort posts about the Brazilian scene. Delusional Fans: There are many of these, such as number1_ScreaM_fan and DELUSIONAL_POTTER_FAN . However, the most known of these is DELUSIONAL_MITCH_FAN . Find these users being absolutely delusional (shocking). HackNaija : How one man can be so delusional over Soniqs is a mystery. Issax28 : A newer user who has made a name for themself by posting the most awful takes known to humankind. These are just some of the users you will meet here. There are many other great users to meet, and many more who will be unimaginably stupid. That does it for your tour! I hope you find your stay at VLR just as miserable as mine!""]( ----------------------------------- most downvotes received: -11 ""Are you trying to lose stars?"" ----------------------------------- please note that total num of upvote/downvote/dead count may not reflect your total post count as your posts can be deleted. also note that biggest fan is basically the user that has replied to your comments, not threads",Pakistan,1,20/5/2024,14:55,22/11/2023,16:01

We have been completely shat on only two games vs PRX and DRX. Good Things: 1.We are good on comms and team chem. Sometimes we do go overboard, but overall good. Benkai switch to secondary caller looking good. LF and Russ have looked the most stable over the course. Pistol rounds and Anti-eco have looked really good. (We lost one on Icebox, but won the next round against RRQ) Icebox looks pretty solid. Polvi finding form on rifle. Bad Things: Weak in fundamentals. We don't check corners :( Lost two big rounds against talon and zeta due to that. Weak Map pool. opponent pick and third map seems to be a big problem. Also lost 2-0 both times when opponent banned icebox. Polvi OP crunching has not looked as good as it should. Lost of misses even when there was good opportunities given and other times had to take too much risk to find impact. Scaling when polvi has op has looked shaky on attack side, with inefficient trading. It definitely looked like nerves played a big part in lot of the results. Genuine Advice: Expand Map Pool. Everyone knows by now that Icebox is perma-pick, and u look strong on it. Teams surely will start to ban it on Split 2. So, need to have a new perma pick and a better secondary pick. We have horrendous buy round conversion considering we have highest pistol and anti-eco win rate. Control pacing of the round better. We played to their style in both DRX and PRX games. (especially PRX) Even though some might feel this team is a downgrade from last year, trust me, it isn't. Team chem will nearly always impact more than cracked individuals. Last year the language barrier and some other reasons impacted team chem. This year we definitely have 2 very good callers in benkai and russ, and team looks very well gelled. Hopefully, only better things to look for in split 2.""]( ----------------------------------- most downvotes received: -6 ""there are really aren't. only one who is good enough is skrossi and we saw him last year"" ----------------------------------- please note that total num of upvote/downvote/dead count may not reflect your total post count as your posts can be deleted. also note that biggest fan is basically the user that has replied to your comments, not threads",Pakistan,1,2/7/2024,5:07,22/11/2023,16:01

I personally think that kicking someone when they're down is cringe, but you are one of the last people to preach about this. On your own region's broadcast, there was a whole segment where Steel shit on yay, who isn't even in that region. Doing this on official broadcast absolutely feeds into the hate yay is recieving, which is 10 times worse than anything Boaster is getting, and literally drove yay out of competing this season. Where was this concern about players' mental health then? During this tournament's swiss stage, c0m also recieved 10 times the hate Boaster is getting. Once again, where was this concern of yours when the toxicity was directed to someone other than your boyfriend? If you want people to take you seriously, then maybe you should make a tweet apologizing for the yay segment on EMEA broadcast, and speak up for players not named Boaster as well. Also, tell your friend Kaquka that I think it's really classy of her to use Twisten's gravestone as a pedestal to hypocritically preach about mental health (the EMEA broadcast segment applies to her too.) edit: I was hoping Yinsu would make a genuine apology acknowledging the yay segment. Instead we got a non-apology with restricted replies. The mods over on the valcomp subreddit also deleted a thread about her apology because all the comments were pointing out how the apology didn't address anything. links with additional context:  ----------------------------------- most downvotes received: -14 ""100T 2-1 Loud"" ----------------------------------- please note that total num of upvote/downvote/dead count may not reflect your total post count as your posts can be deleted. also note that biggest fan is basically the user that has replied to your comments, not threads",Pakistan,1,4/7/2024,13:35,22/11/2023,16:01

Something is fishy,General Discussion,"I have come to the conclusion that neither rob or shahz is telling the complete truth. shahz is probably blowing things out of proportion and twisting the truth because he is salty he was dropped. Rob on the other is trying to keep good PR of SEN so he is twisting the truth. Both sides at fault for the lack of communIcation and mismanagement of the situation. And boths sides publicly arguing over a thread of a SEN content short making a joke is just idiotic. If there was a serious problem between the two, twitter is definitely not the place I would go. Unless either side can provide concrete proof of their accusations consider this argument point less and a bait for impressions.",Taiwan,6,13/1/2023,24:13,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,"imo def the most likely explanation. rob probably said something like ""if you team up with shroud we'll likely keep you in sen"" and shaz took that as a guaranteed spot. no other explanation would have shaz call them out and rob deny everything",United States,26,13/1/2023,24:15,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,I think that when figuring who to sub. Rob and esports management proposed and encouraged Shroud. There prob some incentive but im p sure it wasnt a promised spot. Rob and shahz knows that with franchising no ones spot is guaranteed. Shahz then argeed because shroud has then fps talent and no one else stood out particularly. I think there is a clear middle story and both sides are stretching it for their argument. But still arguing over twitter?? Like cmon,Taiwan,5,13/1/2023,24:19,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,shahz been in controversies since cs and been a dickhead since cs not denying rob may be stretching the truth BUT shahz was no saint in the situation and is lowk an asshole no team with him will work out,Finland,3,13/1/2023,24:41,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,Yeah. Im just hesitant to declare a winner because we actually have no proof or insight from an outside source on what actually happened bts.,Taiwan,2,13/1/2023,24:45,13/1/2023,24:13

Something is fishy,General Discussion,Finally someone that speaks logic,Malaysia,0,13/1/2023,24:29,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,"My theory is that Shahz all of last year blew the team off because of org frustrations in how they wouldn't sign a proper coach and analyst To be clear I think he was still trying, but imagine all these other orgs having all these resources surpassing you and your org is denying that you get the proper help they need. I mean wasn't Sen investing in Halo before making sure one of their biggest sources of revenue for the org retains itself? Shahz bad attitude, but for good reason as well I mean look at how well Sen did with Shroud and Zellsis in such a short amount of time once they actually had that support Imagine if the org had supported them like that the entire year leading up",Qatar,4,13/1/2023,24:31,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,Im going to be honest. But I think streaming 8+ hours a day is at least slightly not trying to win. Im not saying he can’t stream. But when you are losing and then spending 8 hours streaming. There is something more you can do. I personally don’t have a problem his streaming but i refuse to think shahz gave 110% in his preparation when he is streaming 40 hours a week.,Taiwan,3,13/1/2023,24:35,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,40 hours is a full time job .,United States,0,13/1/2023,24:36,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,"Yeah, i have mad respects shahz and his grind in general. But like when something is going wrong, you need to change something. That didn’t really happen. Is some stuff out of his control. Definitely, but i feel like shifting the blame on external factors like sick taking a break, tenz moving, etc. is actually contradictory to shahz’s recent tweet about owning up to your mistakes",Taiwan,1,13/1/2023,24:40,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,"You also have to remember he was doing 3 people's jobs For the first year he was Coach and Analyst as well as IGL After that they got Rawkus to relieve him a little bit, but that only takes the load bearing and puts part of it on Rawkus There's no systems in place to make sure he has the support he need or to limit him to what he's doing or not doing I understand he's an adult and can make his own decisions, but sometimes you need an outside perspective to help you realize what's going wrong.",Qatar,0,13/1/2023,24:38,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,"I do agree that somethings you don’t know what’s going on. But shahz is smart enough to take 1 hour out of his stream to maybe do more review to fix those problems. Instead of doubling down on his, “its out of my control” and “its not due my streams”",Taiwan,0,13/1/2023,24:43,13/1/2023,24:13

Something is fishy,General Discussion,Fair but i just personally think he could’ve more but you make a valid point i just dont 100% agree,Taiwan,2,13/1/2023,24:48,13/1/2023,24:13
Something is fishy,General Discussion,I just feel like its unfair as well for an org owner to solely blame the player that blew up Sentinels in such a way that they've gained a franchising spot It's not just Rob either it's the entirety of management Like they have employees and still no help It's just a very lopsided exchange imo,Qatar,0,13/1/2023,24:55,13/1/2023,24:13

Rank these Jetts,General Discussion,"Being fully honest this might be the hardest ranking to do. First there should be at least buzz in the list as well, maybe demon1 too. But fr the competition is just so high that you could argue a lot of players as top1 because of how high their ceiling and peaks are. Though, you have to say that some players have to be more at the bottom for some reason; zekken is not good enough on jett compared to the best ones obviously, miniboo (....), hyunmin we can't say for now but I don't feel like he'll be that much better, kinda same for Mada. Keznit still has a big big potential but can't say because kru didn't perform well enough. Oxy is weird cuz his average is just so so high that I have trouble judging him, but kinda in the same spot as Keznit. Those of you who put Primmie that low I can't understand tho, obviously he's not that proven yet but we all know that he's a beast and that he's the archetype of a goat jett. Every other player can be argued as top 1 because of a lot of things, wether it's their peaks or their overall consistency and great intelligence. Somethingg is a bit special there tho, because, of course we all know how good he can be, but his jett is just on a whole different tier in terms of mastering the agent. He plays her so comfortably in such a unique and efficient way compared to anyone else that you could put him anywhere in the top 5 i think",France,0,9/12/2024,11:55,9/12/2024,10:08

Only to find out that your average VCT scouting/analysis report is 1/200th the size. The reason I'm bringing this up is because I'm tired of seeing Nadeshot and 100 Thieves continue the narrative that they are trying everything they can. They simply are not. They are just continuing the one thing that has plagued esports, cronyism. The normal size of an analysis report in VCT is 1-2 pages.

100T Coaching Search Application,Off Topic,"Hey! I know everyone has been supportive, but I'd like to offer an alternative perspective of why this is the way it is Scouting reports are made for the players and Head Coach to look at and develop a gameplan, or to find specific antis that will win them a few rounds. These players are busy people, and I can promise you that it's far more worth their time to play 1 scrim than read 113 pages of information that won't even enter their heads. They know what Icebox is, they don't need to know that it's based on Bennet Islands... Something that teams genuinely look for when finding people to do these kind of reports is the ability to keep things short, sweet, easy to interpret, and easy to implement. Most of my reports are ~20 pages tops for all 7 maps, and most of that is pictures rather than text (especially stuff that looks VERY AI written - sorry) I'm sure the effort was appreciated, but I think if you put the same amount of effort into the details that you did the overarching context and irrelevant things, you might find some stuff that can help win games rather than just describe them",United Kingdom,268,27/1/2025,8:28,27/1/2025,7:11

100T Coaching Search Application,Off Topic,Skimmed through this. While its a ton of info there's not an easily readable amount of information. While you included executes and what they used I don't see a default section at all. Only player movements. My advice in the future is to break it down in a simple direction. Most teams will use one of a number of defaults when working map control. Obviously these can be faked however your team would then at least know off of maybe a recon and stun what the enemy team is roughly doing and their positions. A lot what you included isn't actually helpful except for some of the postplant locations. Its an impressive amount of work but its focused in the wrong areas to help a team.  This for instance is much more helpful because you'll see this actually happen immediately a lot. By going over this my players would know roughly where the enemy team is and can weigh whether they want to take space or overrotate or be ready for something.,United States,312,27/1/2025,8:51,27/1/2025,7:11

I'm going to give you the advice that I've given to every aspiring analyst/strategic coach who's asked me for feedback on documentation like this. Having this level of depth is great and some coaches will value it highly, but for 90% of use cases, this is absolutely useless. Something that was driven home to me very quickly in my time in private equity was that if you can communicate what needs to be communicated in fewer words, do it. A firm's partner isn't going to read a 25 page report, they'll read your 1-page summary and that 1-page summary better be excellent. In top tier esports it may not be a partner who's reading, but it's a player. For how much of your report will their attention span hold? and how much of what they cover in that attention span will they actually retain in a way that it's actionable? When I anti, could I produce this sort of document? Sure. Do I though? Absolutely not. I provide a 12 - 20 slide ""elevator pitch"" style deck that communicates core concepts in as easy-to-retain a format possible, and then I provide a 1-pager in addition to that that's basically 8-15 bullet points of 1-3 sentences each that give very concise actionable conclusions with linked references. I have all my rough notes that I can use to cite/further explain if needed, but I'm not going to waste my time formatting those into a comprehensive report that no one other than me should need to read if I'm doing my job well enough. Even then, how a HC wants their reports provided is preferential. It feels bad to have your hard work feel like it wasn't respected or given due consideration, but not you, not I, not anyone, is entitled to that at the end of the day.

100T Coaching Search Application,Off Topic,"First, none of this truly matters. If you're reading this post please consider donating to the victims of the Los Angeles fires:  Second, someone cool helped me out with my submission and I want to give him a shoutout, Nabil Elouahabi, basically gave me a bunch of dialogue that I created a fun video for my submission. He has a Cameo page and you should check it out (  ) Third, I think a couple of important people jumped to conclusions about my work. I don’t think you can fit my system into the traditional way of doing things. While I appreciate their critiques, their time spent was a bit misguided. I would also like to take the time to again point out the current state of the landscape. We see what the current work leads to. My comments about the size of the analysis that is handed over to players should alarm you as a viewer. You cannot truly believe that handing a one page response to a player is anything close to professional. If you disagree with me, I would point you to HBO specials like Hard Knock:  . Just look at the binders they carry around. That sort of preparation is what leads to amazing sports moments. Talent needs knowledge to thrive. Many people do not have this knowledge required so they make it about other things. Thank you to the people who took the time to read my work. Good or bad, if you actually took the time to read it, I appreciate you. The context that is missing from the critiques is that my work leads to discussions. The number one rule in any sort of strategy effort is that your perfect plan is going to fail. The sizing of this is supposed to acknowledge that. There needs to be a foundation from which knowledge can grow. A one page analysis of your analysts thoughts and conclusions is not going to get you there. You don’t know any of the inputs such as their skill and knowledge of the subject, how they are feeling, what experience they have in composing documents that require them to be non-bias or even if they had a bad breakfast. I spent some time on individual players. But I think many of my critics think it is just the 100T and FNC players. Nope, it was 19 different teams.  I didn’t feel like I could adequately give an analysis report without doing the film. So in addition to my work and research into the players, I needed to see the games that the past teams played to see if there were any adjustments in the way they played. An analysis would be pointless if it was an entirely different roster/comp/coach. So what I did was cut every single game into rounds. From each of those rounds I created a mini-map focused video. This way I could see at a high level what is usually missed in analysis work if you were purely using VCT footage.  Once again, the goal of my work is not the output. It’s the path I journey to get to a place of expertise that can then be utilized by the organization. I'm not going to attack anyone individually but I would just like to point out that my work is a direct attack on theirs. To see what someone is capable of and then to have to look at your work product can produce jealousy. As people in positions of privilege they should look at my work and applaud it. I tried and produced something of value. It's just weird that you would take 10 minutes of skimming it to try and destroy it. That's some shameful stuff.

If you mix the tracker ranked data with the data of previous performances, it gives you a pretty clear idea of how they will perform. I don't think there is enough discussion and agreement on the fundamentals. The conversations that come out of those are more towards unification of ideas. If a player feels that holding on site is the best way to do something and you have a player on the opposite side of that then that's a discussion you should have. And there are hundreds of those discussions to be had all across the map. Everyone has to be on the same page or the house of cards can collapse. On top of this, you pretty much need to have a mutual understanding of how your teammates are going to respond to things.

100T Coaching Search Application,Off Topic,"In this forum thread, a user expresses frustration after applying for a coaching position with 100 Thieves (100T), following an open call for coaches by Zikz and the org. The user invested a significant amount of time and effort into creating extensive analysis reports (totaling over 100 pages) for 100T’s maps, Icebox and Haven. Despite this effort, they claim they were ""ghosted"" after reaching out to Zikz for feedback, and they later discovered that VCT scouting reports are typically much shorter, around 1-2 pages. The user criticizes the 100T organization, including Nadeshot, for not genuinely pursuing the best talent and perpetuating ""cronyism"" in esports. They argue that 100T’s failure to respond shows a lack of professionalism and accountability. Other forum users sympathize with the effort but offer critiques, noting that the report is too long and filled with redundant or irrelevant information. Several users suggest that esports organizations typically prefer concise, actionable reports over long, detailed ones. The report, they argue, could have been more focused on key game strategies, player tendencies, and actionable insights, rather than excessive details like players' social media handles or map aesthetics. A few users provide constructive feedback, urging the original poster to focus on shorter, more impactful content. Others support the user, criticizing 100T’s management for not responding and claiming the current coaching landscape in esports is flawed. There’s also a wider debate about how esports organizations handle applications, with some pointing out that it’s not unusual for applicants to be ignored and that the quality of work, regardless of the effort, matters more. In the latter parts of the thread, the user defends their work, explaining that the level of detail was meant to spur discussion and provide a deep understanding of team dynamics. They argue that their extensive approach could lead to valuable insights for improving gameplay and fostering better team communication. Ultimately, they express frustration with the esports system and challenge the current coaching methods, which they believe aren't effective in improving team performance.

Also, keep in mind that you need to be producing these at least weekly and sometimes every other day in a tournament setting. There is no time. Communicating 3-5 actionable points in the simplest possible terms is literally the only thing useful to Valorant pros. Too much information is as bad or even worse than too little.

Idk why you are so adamant in undermining coaches instead of trying to understand it from their POV. you assume that because teams lose more than they win, the problem must lie with the coaching. Do you expect coaches to read these huge documents instead of something like VOD reviewing or preparing and expanding their own playbooks? You sure seem to understand SO much about coaching despite having never done it yourselfm You just seem resentful and bitter that you weren't chosen out of dozens, if not hundreds of potential applications by 100T and you are taking it out on the people who did make it into tier 1 teams as coaches.

100T Coaching Search Application,Off Topic,"Here is some of my critics To me you should provide a fast access to conclusion, in the first pages, if the lector does agree he won't need to read further, and if he disagrees, then it's interesting to ding into the tons of page you made to check if you are right or not. (I tend to disagree that people that say 100 pages is too long, because, they are 2 possibility, either you bring idea the coach already have and it's not that usefull or the coach disagree with the conclusion and then you need a lot of fact to convince him, because a human being will have issues to be convinced by something because being convince mean you where wrong and too many people have too mush ego to realize it), Page 4, you didnt put the sample you take, so we can't check if thats true or not of if they are bias induced by the sample you picked. I'm not sure what the 13 pages of individual analysis bring, descriptive analysis should always give a prescriptive analysis, and after 13 page for each they are no prescription. Kinda the same for in game analysis. it's good to do it, but that should be. For exemple after making a full description of every round you should analysis the few reason why the round was lose, then you can make a statistic on how frequent a reason is and finally you propose a solution for the most frequent mistake that lead to lose So in conclusion : Try to make it like an iceberg, conclusion in 3 first pages maximum, then result that lead to the conclusions in next 10 pages maximum, and if thats not enough, then the coach will be able to read all the data you collected in the next 100 page if that wasn't enough, with in it describing methodology, and giving a lot and lot and lot of singular example. Also, keep in mind that your rapport need to answer to a precise problematic, I suppose in yours it's ""How to improve 100T Icebox"" So to summum : Prescriptive conclusion > Analyzing statistics > Descriptive Individual data. (Inverse order on how we should work, thats why it's weird to present it like that) PS : And please continue your work even if some critics are hard, thats how you learn !

Honorable mention to potter for turning eg from the worst team in the leauge to 2nd at tokyo and title contenders at champs, with a roster full of nobodies. She probably would have been first if not for prx doing so well with cgrs Rookie demon1, no suprise whats not to say hes contending for one of the best players in the leauge carrying his team through playoffs to tokyo and then put up astunding performances to get them to second and top 3 at champs.",Palestine,0,25/8/2023,4:05,25/8/2023,3:58

yinsucollins reciepts,General Discussion,"Mods, I'm putting this thread under ""Valorant"" because it relates to how valorant players are treated by the audience. If you feel it should be under ""Off-topic"", please move it there and don't delete. To Yinsu: You made this tweet about people clowning on your boyfriend. I personally think that kicking someone when they're down is cringe, but you are one of the last people to preach about this. On your own region's broadcast, there was a whole segment where Steel shit on yay, who isn't even in that region. Doing this on official broadcast absolutely feeds into the hate yay is recieving, which is 10 times worse than anything Boaster is getting, and literally drove yay out of competing this season. Where was this concern about players' mental health then? During this tournament's swiss stage, c0m also recieved 10 times the hate Boaster is getting. Once again, where was this concern of yours when the toxicity was directed to someone other than your boyfriend? If you want people to take you seriously, then maybe you should make a tweet apologizing for the yay segment on EMEA broadcast, and speak up for players not named Boaster as well. Also, tell your friend Kaquka that I think it's really classy of her to use Twisten's gravestone as a pedestal to hypocritically preach about mental health (the EMEA broadcast segment applies to her too.) edit: I was hoping Yinsu would make a genuine apology acknowledging the yay segment. Instead we got a non-apology with restricted replies. The mods over on the valcomp subreddit also deleted a thread about her apology because all the comments were pointing out how the apology didn't address anything. links with additional context:",United States,215,2/6/2024,5:04,2/6/2024,5:04

yinsucollins reciepts,General Discussion,"Let me break down everything you said and counter you: ""Blaming her for a segment Steel did"" - Steel is her coworker and she was on the broadcast when Steel was roasting the fuck out yay. So this is not something that she is not completely involved in? She could've said something then, but no as long as its not boaster its ok right? ""Also her tweet was about how the hate can have a negative affect on players mental health. She lives with Boaster of course she is going to see this first hand and make a tweet"" - I don't mind her defending her boyfriend infact it would be weird if she didn't but that is coming from a standpoint when we see her as boaster's gf. Me personally when yinsu is on the broadcast i see her as a talent, infact i didn't even know they were dating until recently. I think when you make such points about mental health of player, people are going to see it from the stand point of her being a talent on the broadcast. For example: Coms dad always defends him if com has a bad performance, do you see anyone shitting on com's dad? no because he never shits on other players, he always stands up for his son. We only know him as coms dad, he is not out there on the broadcast making fun of other players bad performances and downfalls. But she was actively involved with people who were making fun of other players performance, she didn't have any problem laughing it off then? ""She isn't even in the same region as com. Only sees him in person at events. barely knows him. Is she suppose to be his fucking therapist?? Lawyer? You want her to be a social justice warrior for every valorant player? trashing her for defending her partner is crazy work."" - Com attended masters shanghai fyi, you can see many threads about his performance, no one had a word to say about that, the only person who said anything was coms dad. ""Only sees him at in person event and barely knows him"" - So if someone she doesn't know gets hate that's fine? Not saying she has to go type out replies to all the keyboard warriors over here but you are only seeing her as boasters gf, she is a person who has a large influence over the community, she should stand up or at least tell people to stop shitting on players when they have bad performances. Nobody asked her to be a therapist or lawyer, just be equal to all. Not mixing up work and relationships is a very simple task, so when you enforce such tweets, please see that the general public will see it from the stand point of her being a talent on the broadcast and not boasters gf. Lastly, i wanna see the hate against all players is a part of esports.

yinsucollins reciepts,General Discussion,"As an employee, you always have the option to say ""I'm not comfortable doing this"" or ""I think doing this thing is wrong"". So even if it was pushed by Riot Production overlords, you have the choice to voice opposition. Or if she didn't know and it just happened while she was on the desk, she has the chance afterwards to say ""Hey, I thought this segment was too much."" But she didn't. If anything, in her interactions with Steel across various casts, she seems to goad on his hating. And before you try to say ""she has to worry about job security"", the entirety of plat chat is boycotting casting in Shanghai because of their disagreements with practices of the Chinese government. Making a tweet after the broadcast saying ""Hey, i think this segment was harsh and unnecessary. I don't think we should encourage hate on the broadcast."" would be appropriate if you truly care about the mental health of players in the scene. The problem I have with her isn't the fact of her defending her boyfriend; that's fine. The problem is that she is admonishing the audience for something she helped encourage towards others. Now, coming onto what you said in #111. First of all, you are pushing an assumption about production control as fact. And as I said above, you still have the choice as an employee to voice disapproval. Secondly, there is evidence to suggest that the whole segment was planned by the broadcast talent/with broadcast talent approval. If you watch all the discussion that occurred around the time when Americas production showed FNS' stats from the MiBR game in 2023, the conclusions from that were that local production and desk analysts have a lot of control over the show, and if things were left entirely to them, they wouldn't fine anyone for shooting bodies. So if we're going to make assumptions based on data, it is more likely that Yinsu was at the very least passively involved in the creation of the segment. Lastly, ""she doesn't see the effect/toll of other players receiving hate"" is such an infuriating and hair-splitting bullshit argument. As a human being capable of fucking logical reasoning, if you/a loved receiving hate negatively affects you, it is fucking OBVIOUS that someone receiving even more intense hate will be affected. In the case of yay, she even DID SEE how it was affecting him because of yay's depressed tweets. So it would be good of her to CONSISTENTLY discourage hate in the community, not only when it comes around to someone she cares about. To wrap it up, no one is saying defending your loved ones is a bad thing. That is a mischaracterization of this thread. This thread is highlighting her hypocritical act, and the goal of it is to get her to start discouraging excessive hate whenever it happens, which she is in a position to do as a leading broadcast talent.",United States,2,2/6/2024,24:05,2/6/2024,5:04

So to start off, i never mentioned that she should cancel that segment or that she has the power to cancel the segment. I simply said she could've tweeted something or said something. It could've been after seeing the segment or anytime after. If she wanted to tweet something about a players mental health, how come she didn't tweet anything that time. That said player (yay) got 10 times the hate boaster is getting rn, infact steel was so nice to give him a vct segment, did all that warrant to nothing? why not tweet something then? if this was about defending players from hate, that would've been a great time to start no? Also i wanna add, i understand that yinsu is a part of the broadcast not the entire broadcast itself, she doesnt not have the power to stop the an entire segment or change the production material at all. ""Again refer to #111 or what I wrote before. Attacking Yinsu as if she is the face of VCT EMEA is crazy."" -- Could you please mention the part where i said/insinuated that yinsu is face of VCT EMEA? also i never attacked her, I'm simply wondering why when there were people being disrespectful/mean towards yay, how come she didn't say anything like she did right now? I respect yinsu, but the timing of the tweet is kinda off considering all the things that have happened. ""Trying to put words in my mouth is crazy. As you know, I was saying she doesn't know com personally, so she doesn't see any tolls that the hate might take on his mental health, as she does with Boaster."" -- This one is a funny one, cuz how did i put words into your mouth? Do you see the question mark at the my message, it means I'm asking you so please don't throw meaningless garbage into this conversation. The she doesnt see any trolls argument, ahaha are you serious? How come she saw all the tweets, threads, reddit posts about boaster? Does this mean she has a way of seeing the hate without the hate? She must've opened those respective websites right? I know she doesnt know c0m personally but I'm sure she must've seen all the tweets and hate threads. She even follows c0ms dad and he was actively tweeting about it and now if that isisnt enough proof, i don't know what is. ""Except that she literally didn't! She made the tweet on HER YinsuCollins Twitter account! Her PERSONAL account! Not from the VCT EMEA account. Again a personal account! She is being attacked for giving her opinions on her own account!"" -- This is her twitter bio btw (Freelance Esports Host/Interviewer & VALORANT Content Creator), pretty sure it says that she is a person of her own. Her job is an esports interviewee, so please see her that way. When in a public environment, she is a esports talent not boasters gf and all tweets made will be seen that way. Infact i personally think you're belittling her by seeing her as someone girlfriend so please refrain from doing so. She her as her own person. And your argument that her twt account yinsucollins is a personal account, so is there a professional account? if so please direct me to that, i will apologize for this statement. And why would she tweet from the VCT EMEA account, that's completely irrelevant? She can give her opinion all she wants, she has the right to do so, but when it was happening to someone other than her boyfriend right in front of her eyes, she should've said something if she truly believed what she said.

Plenty of people on plenty of broadcasts at Riot have just let segments go by that they didn't support.

Hold the men on broadcast to the same standard.   Do you not care about Tombizz doing the same thing? Also about Plat Chat, Sideshow stepped away because of his own, in my opinion, hypocritical beliefs about China (anything you think China is doing the US is doing) so if you care about hypocrisy why don't you call that out? For the rest of Plat Chat, as far as we know Bren didn't go because his casting partner didn't go, Wyatt has never been to a LAN before no reason to think he turned down an invite and Balla turned down an invite for the last LAN cause of his young kid and presumably did that again.

yinsucollins reciepts,General Discussion,"I have no idea why you're so hyper focused on gender.

And by the way, with all the things you're trying to imply, you're assuming that I'm a certain gender. I think Yinsu didn't voice opposition because 1. she didn't voice any opposition publicly(which was the most important thing to do) and 2. she was on the desk and seemed to have fun with Steel's segment. As a public figure, not voicing opposition to something means you functionally approve of it. If Tombizz was on the cast that day/saw the yay segment, then yes, everything I said here applies to him too. Tombizz's tweet didn't get reposted everywhere because he isn't as promiment as a figure as Yinsu and Kaquka. So sorry I didn't see Tombizz's tweet I guess? And back when Steel did the segment, I voiced disagreement about it and him specifically. There is no mysterious targeting of only female talent here. With respect to Sideshow and Platchat, yes, the US gov does many bad things, but living in the US is 100% better than China. In this country you can say ""Fuck Trump"" and ""Fuck Joe Biden"" when they are in the most powerful position in the country without repercussions, which is something you cannot do in China. China is a totalitarian country; to say that the US is as totalitarian as China is asinine. And with respect to your Balla point, then kindly explain why Balla has joined the boys in Korea.

yinsucollins reciepts,General Discussion,"I feel like you have good intentions here, but absolutely missed the mark. Why spread more targeted hate when (at least based on your other comments) its the very thing you're criticizing? Why not uplift com and yay, pointing out how they need support too? A criticism based on assuming the worst in someone at every step is pointless; there is nothing to be gained from blaming her for her coworkers, assuming she agrees with everything they do and agrees with how we on vlr treated com/yay, while disregarding every time she advocates for players mental health. I dont know how yays mental was during the steel segment. You dont know how yays mental was during the steel segment. And Yinsu doesnt know how yays mental was during the steel segment. She does know how boasters mental is right now. She can tell people about it. Had Yay had someone like that maybe that whole shit hadnt gone down that way. I dont see how this is a bad thing. Encourage people who know the players to speak up when theyre struggling so that we as a community dont overdo it! And since this was brought up multiple times on post you agreed with explicitly: her mixing in her personal life, on her personal twitter account isnt a problem and youre just an idiot if thats what you take issue with. She hasnt even used it to look for work yet (this is the only tweet I could find searching for the common lfw posts, and if you think thats a serious resume then we gotta talk  ) Like this aint a chapter in the bible, we cant have only those without sin be allowed to throw the stone. Especially when the thing theyre advocating for would better the community. We dont have a Jesus on earth right now, nobody is gonna be allowed to do jack shit to better anything.

the future of PRX,General Discussion,"is the player ""something"" the right move for PRX? prx's issue isn't with their duelists imo, but something seems like a good duelist player. does he replace jinggg or f0rsaken or someone else, and if he replaces someone else, what will the role shifts be for jinggg and forsaken? i'm just worried prx is either going to keep playing double duelist or chamber + duelist on every map when that isn't the meta imo. now i know how it felt to be a sentinels fan in 2022, this shit hurts :( based off raw aim alone they clear half of the franchised teams, but if they keep forsaken, jinggg, and add something, i don't see them being an S tier team this year :/",United States,7,8/3/2023,2:16,8/3/2023,2:16

the future of PRX,General Discussion,Could be completely wrong but I was thinking that f0rsaken will probably be some sort of flex player depending on what they want to do.,China,2,8/3/2023,2:22,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,Idk jing or forsaken might both be flex and switch with team depending on comp from my observation agro players like fisker changing roles (smoke for fisker) resulted in better stats and more impact since he's alive more catches them with unexpected aggression etc,Hong Kong,0,8/3/2023,2:23,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"I think it can work if they force the ""double dive"" comp , like the one loud used Raze - Jingg Jett- smth/f0rsaken init - ? controller - ? controller/sent (depending on maps) the other roles im not too sure about.",Wales,-2,8/3/2023,2:23,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,It will work but it won't fix anything. They don't need another insane duelist when they have forsaken and jingg.,South Korea,0,8/3/2023,2:28,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,people really forgot that f0rsaken also cracked as initiator or sentinel,International,0,8/3/2023,2:54,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,there's a major difference between cracked aim and cracked roles,Europe,0,8/3/2023,2:55,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,just watch how he use util okay? don't focus just on aim. You said that because you were distracted by the aim,International,0,8/3/2023,2:57,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,you have no idea what you're talking about lmfao,Europe,0,8/3/2023,2:57,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,it's just you bringing him into aim context when I really talk about the role play potential,International,0,8/3/2023,3:01,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,comprehension issue smh what role potential? hv u ever seen someone put f0rsaken in their top 10 or 20 initator/sentinel? he looks good on the role coz of his aim not because of how he plays the role,Europe,0,8/3/2023,3:30,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"never seen someone put f0rsaken as top 20 init because his best potential on duelist lmao hahaha and the last time he played init was during apac lcq. So thas why no one put f0rsaken as one of best init. But now they found a duelist who has the same potential as forsaken, this makes them have the option to play back forsaken for another role, and thats will definitely better than davai/benkai",International,0,8/3/2023,16:54,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"controller mindfreak, right?",Spain,0,8/3/2023,20:52,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,I’m skeptical about adding Something to PRX. I don’t think they need another cracked duelist aimer. I feel like they need more of a player like Less or MaKo. Someone who is calm and won’t overheat/overpeek all the time,China,13,8/3/2023,2:26,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"THIS. Thank you for perfectly explaining it. They need either 1-2 cracked support players (in place of mindfreak and davai) to stabilize this team. I have confidence they can learn to play more methodically and tighten things up, but they need more players who think strategically on the team. It’s sad to say cut players but I honestly think it’s the best option.",United States,0,8/3/2023,22:29,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,PRX get nephh plsssssss,Singapore,1,8/3/2023,22:37,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,its the best move plays onto PRX strength. More fire power with good trading and they can play their playstyle better.,China,0,8/3/2023,2:29,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,f0rsakeN sentinel flex maybe,Indonesia,0,8/3/2023,2:30,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"I think forsaken's going to switch to a flex role which I believe will be a good move for him going forward. the trend so far has been that players like him move to the flex role and players like asuna have shown that they can still frag while playing more utility-based and supportive roles, I think he can do the same. even though he's traditionally played jett op in the past, he's played raze in the past and famously was good when flexing on to an agent like yoru. prx have also experimented with him on sova in the past. I think he has potential to be really flexible and shifting to a different role with something slotting in the jett role can be really good. And if it doesn't work they can try again next year with something on jett op and forsaken on jinggg's old role which he's played in the past.",Thailand,9,8/3/2023,2:32,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"Not to mention he only plays support agents in Ranked, barely even plays duelists.",India,0,9/3/2023,19:31,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"f0rsaken initiator + chamber roles could really work.. benkai going back to sentinel main.. btw f0rsaken agents pool is big, this dud even playing viper and astra better than most 1trick duelist player..",Europe,0,8/3/2023,2:33,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"Forsaken can literally play anything and something's best agent is Jett. So seems pretty obvious to me, either davai or benkai out and have the 3 beats destroy",Spain,0,8/3/2023,2:33,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"if benkai is out then who igl's? also benkai clearly isn't the issue, the only reason they've gotten to this place was because of benkai's innovation",United States,-3,8/3/2023,2:34,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"I don't think Benkai's Igling is nothing too crazy, PRX is not very structured at all. I'm sure someone could pick that up. But if they don't feel confident I do think -davai might be the move",Spain,3,8/3/2023,2:38,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,Ur actually right. Benkai is not that good igl either,China,1,8/3/2023,2:47,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"I think it's entirely possible he's the issue, props for innovation but the guy just cant keep up with the team, if he at least has bad days good days but he doesn't even have that, he's currently imo probably one the worst players in apac as a region considering where he places every match he just can't stand up for himself, also I feel like he ran out of ideas, I mean my dude literally said on some interview ""we gonna do the same thing we've always done but we gonna be back as the prx from the first masters and just try to play our game without nerves"" or something like that I forgot lazy to check... but the moment I heard that I knew they were gonna lose That just my opinion on it tho xd could be entirely another issue but I really would like to see him at least do more impact in the match",Bosnia and Herzegovina,0,8/3/2023,4:01,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,Ez last place in Apac if they remove benkai,South Korea,1,8/3/2023,2:36,8/3/2023,2:16
the future of PRX,General Discussion,"So something is coming in as to basically play smth like a flex imo, jinggg might move to permanent duelist, and something will play the kayo/second duelist role. Forsaken has played sova as initiator before so I'm pretty sure he might go to the roll. This will all happen if davai gets benched only.",Singapore,1,8/3/2023,2:39,8/3/2023,2:16

the future of PRX,General Discussion,"Davai won't get bench, he will move to igl if needed. Remember he is the second caller in the team, so he has experience igling, maybe benkai will step down as he said he wanted to pursue photography. Besides, benkai is not that good at igl, cause of his mid rounding decision, you can see prx have bad mid round decision cause benkai can't make minor changes",Malaysia,0,8/3/2023,16:02,8/3/2023,2:16

Something wrong with the rankings?,General Discussion,"Why is T1 getting over 30 points for every win, and TSM is getting like between 9 and 12? Even when both teams beat the same opponent 2-0? For instance T1 just beat Immortals 2-0 and gained 35 points for it, While TSM just beat them the day before 2-0 with an even bigger map score win and only gained 14 points for an even larger win? That's a MASSIVE discrepancy and it doesnt end there, all of T1's recent wins are over 30 points. There is either something massively wrong with the formula or there is some massive favoritism going on lol",United States,0,29/6/2020,3:09,29/6/2020,3:09
Something wrong with the rankings?,General Discussion,bro thats how rankings systems work lol high rated team gains less for winning than lower rated team,United States,5,29/6/2020,3:15,29/6/2020,3:09
Something wrong with the rankings?,General Discussion,"in broad strokes #2 is right, but your point about map win margin is on the mark. +/- gain currently factors in match win margin (e.g. 2-0 vs 2-1 in a bo3), but not map win margin (13-0 vs 13-12), which I plan on implementing soon. TSM's relatively small gains are to be expected given that they're the highest rated team in the system at the moment, but T1's big jumps are because they've been inactive for the past month and thus have been stuck close to the initial 1500 rating every team starts at. in the long run this shouldn't matter much, but in the initial stages of the scene a possible remedy could be to manually give clearly ""good"" teams a slightly higher initial rating.",United States,2,29/6/2020,3:41,29/6/2020,3:09
Something wrong with the rankings?,General Discussion,"This makes a bit more sense, but I still dont see how a 34 to 15 difference is called for, that more than double the points gained, on top of theoretically, Immortals ranking is lower when T1 beat them compared to TSM beating them because they had already accrued the loss from the TSM game. I get what you are saying in that T1 didnt have a lot of games so its a catch up of sorts, but that still doesn't seem right. As you said maybe a higher baseline start? But I still dont think you should get more points for wins just because you have less games played. All of their recent wins are in the mid 30s for points while TSM is getting anywhere from 6-12, at what point does T1 start getting 6-12 points for a win?",United States,1,29/6/2020,3:46,29/6/2020,3:09

Something wrong with the rankings?,General Discussion,"got ya, So at around what point does a team like T1 or others with less games start earning the same amount for wins as a team like TSM?

I mean, I can see TSM getting 14 and T1 getting like 15 or 16 maybe.. even that's odd, but 35 to 14?? and they won by less of a round margin?

About JasonR,General Discussion,"Humans have not determined what causes some people to be homosexual so your claim is already bogus. It appears after hormones hit because that is when humans begin to feel sexual attraction...heterosexuality appears at the same time. Furthermore, queerness is not a disorder. A disorder is a state of functioning that disrupts other parts of your life on a daily basis. Being gay is not debilitating. Also, your statement of "" I respect you and all women, but you will never be better than a man"" is so utterly stupid and wrong. Better at what? Valorant? There are plenty of immortal 3 and radiant women that are better than 99% of the men that also play the game.

THEN you go on to say that you don't even have facts to back this up. So...I feel like you proved why your own statement is so idiotic. It is not based on any evidence besides your own biased worldview. 2) Alice is calling the goldy a homophobe and misogynist because he literally just expressed those views. alice just labeled the behavior that goldy was showing. goldy said that ""I respect you and all women, but you will never be better than a man"". That is so obviously misogynistic. goldy also said that being gay is a disorder. That is homophobic. This is literally so simple and self-explanatory that I am struggling to understand how you didn't get this besides the obvious fact that you are also sexist and homophobic. 3) You end on calling alice surprisingly stupid for vlr.

I dont get people who pirate stuff,Off Topic,"Why is this suddenly a very popular thing to ""discuss"" online recently. IMO pirating is the same as not voting in an election for its effect, like the big downside people claim piracy has is that you aren't supporting the people who made the game or film or whatever, which is only really true for indie studios as all the talented people who made the game arent earning commission on the game, they are either salaried or most likely just paid for their work and then released as a freelancer. All the proceeds towards the game pretty much all go to the company valuation and the execs/shareholders profits, which you can argue is the reason theyre getting paid in the first place which brings us back to my first point. Not voting is technically bad for democracy, but there are millions of others who do vote (do buy the game) that your vote (money) is but a drop in the water. Concord being a recent example, imagine if everyone pirated concord instead of buying it. All the devs would have still been paid for their 8 years of work, the game still would have been shut down, the only people at a loss are ubisoft share holders and higher ups. Another argument is that oh if some people pirate then everyone will pirate, mate, pirating has been around since before you were born yet people still go to the cinema (awful) and spend money renting out movies for the price of a week of food. Its a null argument as there are always gonna be way more people who just spend money without thinking, rendering the pirating is bad for the industry argument irrelevent. If the majority of people start pirating instead of spending the extortionate prices for everything, then its effectively voting with your money. Big companies would start lowering their profit margins (which they have the full capability to do so), meaning that Dave the ceo of whatever cinema company might not have the luxury of taking a 50M bonus that year in order to cut costs and sell tickets at a price that reflects their value.

Culture shouldn't exist to only those who can afford it Piracy is a service problem Me personally I don't pirate games, steam has everything I need and the frequent sales means any purchase is justifiable.

I NOTICED SOMETHING,General Discussion,"Shahzam hate thread suddenly came out of nowhere a year ago. I am pretty confident to say that all those comments were made by BabyJ 's alt account. After he got dropped from 100 Thieves because of the 0-13 incident, he was so jealous of shahzam's accomplishments and he was praying for his downfall. BabyJ clearly hated Shahzam from the bottom of his heart for a long time. And he's the type of guy who creates thousands of VLR alt accounts and shit talks about one guy forever. He's a psychopath, his ex-girlfriend even said that. Guys, stop falling into BabyJ's trap and let's stop the hate against shahz. Thank you",Japan,10,10/5/2023,21:44,10/5/2023,21:44

better PRX roleswap,General Discussion,"Is this not literally what they tried previously? The problem is Jing can't play Jett/Yoru and Something can't REALLY play initiator at all. Especially not Breach; he's constantly using util for himself instead of the team on the agent literally designed to prevent you doing that. The solution really is replace Something with a real initiator player (Patmen, ofc) and, since you can't cut him too, improve Jing's non-duelist roles so he still fits the team on the maps you need solo Yoru out of Forsaken. Jing already actually has a better agent pool than something, and plays better on those agents.

better PRX roleswap,General Discussion,"Jingg 100 percent can play jett, its just that something and forsaken are both better jett players so there never was a need to have him on it. If prx ever would need a dedicated duelist jingg over something is better imo. something doesn't even have 100 hours on raze over his lifetime. Something flash initiator is the best option you can have without him getting dropped. Him on recon and smokes is arguably worse and I can't see him playing sentinel either.

It also works by countries, so one side of a country can't be from one region and the other from another, or else people from that country would have the advantage to choose region. So something and jemkin are indeed EMEA players.

Gym Post,Off Topic,"Day 31 is complete Went for an early(ish) bike ride. Did about 13 miles. Idk though since I forgot my Apple Watch Update on progress personally: I've lost about 12lbs (5.5kg) and kept it off, but most of that weight loss is from the beginning of the month so I'm gonna adjust my diet a little bit to get some extra pounds off. For those wondering and making sure I'm losing weight safely I'm 5'8"" (173cm) and started at 230lbs (104kg) and am now 218lbs (99kg). My rule is at least an hour of activity every day. I'm 21 and my body type is like chubby athletic as of right now. Used to be super fit from soccer (please don't flame me I'm American) and wrestling. I still have a lot of muscle from that time and have pretty broad shoulders. As for physical affects since I've started I feel so much more energetic after my exercises and I even have found a difference for my couple of relax days I've done where I feel slightly sluggish. Surprisingly I've actually seen Valorant ranked progression as well. I make sure before I even get on Valorant on my days off I go exercise almost for warmup. I used to hover around Gold 3 and Plat 1-2, and now I'm hovering around Diamond 3 steadily. My headshot percentage has even gone up 5% this act.",Qatar,6,15/9/2022,5:10,16/8/2022,14:25

Diet wise I've gotten some protein shakes and recovery bars for lifting and then just been trying to make better conscious decisions with what my body intakes. As for my weight, it has stayed the same as of recently which is good and means I am still on track. In the summer I was dropping weight pretty quickly due to the 2.5-hour bike rides I loved doing, but rn since there is snow everywhere I can't really do that. Hopefully with these few changes I can see what's working and what isn't so I can adjust as needed Also as for weight I realized while I am not losing weight I am going down in waist sizes so there is a possibility that a lot of the fat is now being replaced with muscle",Qatar,2,23/1/2023,7:56,16/8/2022,14:25

Gym Post,Off Topic,"This is your reminder to hit the gym and stop getting fat. It’s not worth your health. You are putting your body through too much. Diabeetus and cardiovascular disease is serious shit. Those things can rob you of your ability to live, monetarily, physically. People think they have time but really you’re all out of it. Go to the gym, walk your dog, lift some weights. TODAY. Right now!! Also drink more water, and touch some grass. Then when you come back you play valorant with smile on the face, at least for a little bit til you get powned. Oh well. Always someone better. But your health is your health.

Even if you aren't losing weight you're still making sure your body doesn't stay stagnant. You're way more likely to form health defects if you neglect your body. If you don't go to the gym, walk or bike to work/school. If you're traveling. Do some pushups in the hotel room or walk around an airport depending on your circumstances.

Gym Post,Off Topic,"Heres what AI think of you: This sounds suspicious to me and the person may be exaggerating or lying about their gym progress. Here are a few reasons why: Posting about your daily gym progress on a Valorant gaming forum is an odd way to hold yourself accountable. Most people would use a fitness tracker, calendar, or habit tracking app for this. Posting on an unrelated forum seems like an attempt to get attention and praise from others. Claiming to start going to the gym ""every day"" from hardly going at all is an unrealistic goal that rarely works out. For most people, success is built on gradual progress by starting 2-3 days a week and building up from there. Saying you'll go every day right off the bat is dubious. The overly specific call out of having ADHD and struggle with scheduling also seems like an attempt to gain sympathy and make the goal sound more inspiring than it really is. This level of detail is not needed to announce a goal of working out more often. Most people focused on fitness progress will mention specifics about their workouts, stats, or accomplishments, even at a high level. Just posting ""day 1"", ""day 2"" with no detail also casts doubt on whether any exercise actually happened. In summary, while we can't say definitively this person is lying, there are enough questionable factors and missing follow-through to be very skeptical about their claims. At best, they may have had good intentions to start working out more but failed to pull through—at worst, they seem to be exaggerating or fibbing to gain attention and praise from others online with no actual effort made. The lack of specificity in their posts suggests their gym accountability goal lacked sincerity.",United States,-3,3/5/2023,14:09,16/8/2022,14:25

Gym Post,Off Topic,I mean this is a legitimate concern. During this it's kinda redefined my view of going to the gym It doesn't always have to be some big workout a lot of times its just taking care of my body as well. Id say about 10% of these days are just nature walks and the steam room kinda as I feel necessary as a form a therapeutic release or some muscle relaxation. I have a bad background with High school wrestling where I would workout like a dog for months and eat damn near nothing just to cut from 180lbs to 140 (138 was the weight class) just to make weight I wanted to make sure that I wasnt developing some sort of eating disorder or a dependency on needing some hard workout in order to lose weight,Qatar,0,12/5/2023,14:52,16/8/2022,14:25
Gym Post,Off Topic,"one of the things that I really don't like about the gym community is how much it worships treating your body like shit. A lot of influencers talk about hopping on gear, doing dirty bulks, or in general eating like shit and then expecting results, while others shame people for being skinny or fat and mock their appearances to stroke their own egos. Good on you for recognizing a fault in your own life and trying to solve that because that's something people can't always accomplish",United States,-2,12/5/2023,15:19,16/8/2022,14:25

Gym Post,Off Topic,"DISCLAIMER In this post, I will be talking about my body and that may or may not be triggering to others with similar insecurities. Anything I talk about in a bad light is only directed at myself and myself only. No matter what body you may have, your body deserves respect, love, kindness, and patience. There's also going to be pictures of my body that people may or may not find uncomfortable given the amount of vulnerability I'm going to be attempting to show. Course of Events Around August of 2022, I was at the heaviest I have ever been. I had said I started at 230, but realistically It was about 236-237lbs (107.501kg). I was in probably one of the worst places of my life job-wise, and I could barely afford rent having to take a pay decrease after moving cities. I was working part-time and was at home just wasting my time doing nothing probably killing arteries with little to no physical activity. I made this post to change that since at the time this is one of the things that was more consistent. I quickly started dropping weight and within a month I dropped about 10-15lbs. With that sense of control, I quickly found a better higher paying job with more hours and quickly regained a sense of control again of my life, and now in a new city that I thouroughly enjoy. Things I'm proud of So since last year, I have dropped about 36 lbs. weighing in at 201 lbs. (about 91kg). My lowest point was 185lbs (84kg) in late March or early April losing about 50lbs. During this time I was able to see my collarbone, not be so ashamed of how bloated my ankles look, and I totally got rid of my love handles. I woke up every morning (or afternoon because night shift) and felt light and refreshed. Right now I have been bulking and I can now see my chest, back, and shoulders getting bigger and that is HUGE for me since I've never really had any sort of upper body that wasn't comprised of mostly fat. I feel absolutely and totally accomplished knowing I did this all by myself without a trainer and without any sort of guidance in the direction I was going. Even my mental health is gleaming as I feel confident in more revealing shirts, and I also feel like I can do most things much easier like pick something up off the ground or just be physically active for longer. Also, my face is skinnier than any point it has been in the last year, even than when I was at my lightest so it makes me feel like I'm still doing something right. Things I felt were shortcomings While I was dropping weight for months I felt I had no sense of tone. In June I decided I'd start bulking up and lifting heavier. Doing so though has made it so I have to eat more to gain and retain that muscle. Because of that, I've gained some more weight, some of it muscle, and some of it fat. I keep thinking that I am slowly reverting back to what I was, but I have to keep telling myself that those are the eating habits and thoughts I gained from cutting weight for wrestling at the young age of 14. It's really hard to get out of that mindset and I feel disappointed sometimes knowing that I made it my goal to get away from that and it still affects me to this day. I also have these thoughts that I gave myself a year and I should've accomplished more, and it's hard to remind myself that I accomplished what I did without guidance and without a schedule. Things I'm going to change going into this next year One thing I think could improve from my last year or so is that when lifting I felt like I wasn't gaining as much muscle as I could've. I did some research and it looks like maybe I need more full-on rest days so I'm gonna be cutting down to 3 days a week and I'm going to be making my workouts more intentional and focused. I'm also going to try to change from intermittent fasting (which worked very well for just straight-up weight loss) to a high protein, low carb diet. That way, it'll help me retain muscle as well as start to lean out a little and start to show more definition. I am excited for the next year and I've been enjoying the learning this has led me. Thanks to those of you who supported me, and I could give a shit about those of you who doubted me lmao.

But about Jinboong: He had a shit split 2 performance but his split 1 performance was so insane that it makes up for it. I mean there's a reason why Ade keeps singing his praises- calling him ""The Best"" and all, his split 1 performance was just THAT insane. There's a legitimate argument to be made about him being the split 1 mvp rather than Syouta. So his peak obviously is WAY way way higher than Hals and consistency wise, Jinboong might not be the most consistent but neither is Hals. So with that said, despite Jinboong's mid performance in split 2, I think it's disingenuous to claim that Hals>Jinboong off of 1 match where Hals didn't exactly performed that great let alone the greatest kj diff in history.

Jp roster moves megathread,General Discussion,Honestly there is an insane amount of young Korean talents that could be signed. I don't really think it's a big problem as long they don't go full international like Scarz is doing. My biggest problem is them just not really doing scouting properly and getting very mediocre Japanese players in Take or BinBin. Flora was a fa player for the longest time and he is individually insanely cracked. Japanese teams don't understand that there is actually good amount of Japanese regional talent just waiting to get signed. Also on a sidenote do you know where DH is going? He isn't playing in Crest anymore and he is also a top tier Korean talent.,Germany,0,10/9/2024,2:23,12/7/2024,19:43
Jp roster moves megathread,General Discussion,"One of my concerns with imports is they always get the flashy roles ( although not everytime) and hence the japanese players will look bad in the process , this will hurt them in the long run. But yeah, REJECT doesn't go Scarz way and I'm happy with that. Japanese teams don't understand that there is actually good amount of Japanese regional talent just waiting to get signed. This problem has to be stemmed from 2021 because DFM literally thinks it's 2021 with rumours they're signing 3 KRs . Maybe I''m misunderstanding things but Flora is Korean. ( Bro do you know how disappointed I was after realizing he was Korean , here I was thinking a Japanese rank demon finally show up or something ) Also on a sidenote do you know where DH is going? He isn't playing in Crest anymore and he is also a top tier Korean talent. You are looking for the wrong guy bro, have no clue, maybe military service or something, guy is really quite. Never understood why CGZ released both of HYUNMIN and DH tho, but well they replaced them with Ken and Banger but they did not looked as dominant as Hyunmin and DH. I've seen funny discussion in Shitaraba : NOBITA is good but his name sucks that's why he was never considered by Zeta and DFM or somewhere along this line ",International,0,10/9/2024,2:39,12/7/2024,19:43

His history is far too risky for orgs to consider signing him, some also question the procedure with how riot checked Okinawa's innocence. Altho if he really are not cheating, I'll be the one who make sure he lands on a good team . This is a very new roster from cgz aside from Nerufi Brofeld and Sakurai, so I don't think synergy is an issue. Need to see Ken more tho, because his placement in leaderboard definitely did not reflect his performance in vcj. Btw I don't know what happened but Meatpien is out from striderz. Did marin always looked like this? Maybe back then I'm not that invested onto vcj that's why he's kinda off my radar. Popogachi definitely needed help alongside frxeez Speaking of Zeta AC, everyone on the team suddeny becomes active posting clips on twitter lol, it's definitely not like this before, I think it has to do with Zeta going to release/reorganize.",International,0,10/9/2024,3:20,12/7/2024,19:43
Jp roster moves megathread,General Discussion,"Kapi and Chay were a bit unlucky on their previous teams sometimes you just need to find the right one, but tbh since a while ago a lot of the players dramatically improved. Marin/Malinho especially suprised me with how crazy good his stats were in qualifiers and all year in Premier he was easily the best player on NFX this year despite all the roster changes they made, he seems way more comfortable now flexing, his apr is kinda insane ngl. Ken probably just needs time on Crest he was a super late addition to the team. I know that Okinawa could be a risky pr move but also the community itself seems devided on him, but if he is legit which tbf Riot said it means that he is probably the biggest Japanese talent Valorant has seen in a long time, the dude is casually dominating Meiy everytime he faces him in ranked while he sings and screams on streams, he seems like a funny guy. Zeta definitely wants more teams to have eyes on their talent since their previous trainees have been incredible like Aace and Yatsuka. But tbh they might not even need to release them since Academy teams are allowed next year to participate in Challengers, DFM also has tried creating one but I haven't seen a full player announcement yet.",Germany,0,10/9/2024,3:45,12/7/2024,19:43

We all expected Andbox to beat Gen G, but Gen G seems like they've resolved their issues and are back at peak form, like they were at Masters 1 (Top 3 NA) I think its an overall W for NA esports, teams getting much more competitive, even this qualification was the most competitive to date.

They beat sentinels in a bo3, they qualified to challengers playoffs, which made them top 8 NA as well. What has Gen G accomplished in the past 2-3 months?

Why I bring up sports betting as an objective measure is, because it is the most reliable objective measure we have for predicting whether a team is favored or not. You're telling me that for Sentinels vs Soniqs, previous results and feats of both teams wouldnt instantly tell us that Sentinels would obviously win? This example alone factually proves you wrong There are more factors, than just match history to consider and weigh. How you measure how impressive a team's given record is requires assumptions to which there is no valid criterion. There exist objective and subjective criterion for this, but no valid criterion. On vlr.gg gen.g was higher ranked, than andbox; on thespike.gg their ranking has andbox ranked higher, than gen.g. These are both objective criterion based on match history(and some other things), but neither of them are valid, as they do not predict future outcomes. Another objective criterion is to look at an aggregate of bettor opinions, which is what sports betting websites do. This gives a quantitative ratio between the people who think team A will win and people who think team B will win(with money bet of course). This measurement correlates better with the outcome of the game, than any ELO system, game record or other measure(if it didn't, that system would equalize the odds and it would). Therefore, objectively it is a better predictor of which team is favored over the other. This does not make it valid, but it makes it a more reliable predictor, because it outperforms any other objective measure we know of. The measure you are using is subective(your own judgement of the teams records' & what importance it holds), rather than a quantified systemic aggregate of the opinions of many people, which is what sports betting odds are. So no, what you are proposing isn't ""factually right""; it is in fact your own subjective evaluation. The objective in mind is predicting which team is favored to win. The objective measure you can use to measure how good a system is at predicting which team is favored over the other is to simply take the ratio of what predictions you made and how many of them were correct. There's a difference between calling a criterion objective and valid. To call a criterion objective means, that the criterion can quantify the objective with some sort of system.

If there existed a valid criterion, then this disagreement wouldn't happen and you'd be the best sports-bettor in the world. There exist many objective criterion, but no valid one. Your criterion is a subjective one based on your own observation and analysis of the match history. The vlr.gg/thespike.gg rankings are objective criterion based on ranking algorithms, which take in the teams' match histories. To evaluate which criterion is more reliable, all you need to do is calculate which criterion has the highest success-rate.

Did I ever state that the criterion could predict the outcome of the match? No, your premise is false.

There are no assumptions required to assert that a team's record at Iceland like Sentinels was factually perfect, thats not an assumption, yet its measuring, objectively ,the teams record. Envy, at the playoffs, really good, consistent, got 4th. Thats a fact, there are no assumptions needing to be made about the impressiveness of their result and consistency.

Everyone with a brain knows that VLR rankings are trash, and invalid in every way. Therefore they cannot be used as any criterion, they are not objective nor valid. You cannot compare VLR rankings to match history at all lmao, because match history shows actual results in which you can factually determine the best teams in NA based on results, and not some funky invalid ELO VLR ranking. Bettor opinions again dont mean anything, they dont make a team favoured, they are not a valid criterion like match history is. Your entire premise is just so flawed, because I've never stated that there is any valid criterion for determining the outcome of a match, only for what team would be favoured. Objectively the best criterion for favoured team, is again, match results. You are delusional if you deny this.

No, it is not subjective because anyone with a brain would realize that a team like Sentinels would be favoured against a team like Soniqs. Once again, not because of betting, or vlr rankings, but because of match history and accomplishments. What type of retarded fucking logic are you trying to use right now? Its not my 'own judgement' of the teams records and the importance of it, its objective, if a team like soniqs wins a small NSG monthly against tier 2 teams and a team like Sentinels wins Masters 2 against the best teams in the world, obviously objectively sentinels results are much more impressive and accomplished? It is a fact, not an opinion. Your logic is completely flawed. I'm factually right, you're simply delusional, and I've explained why.

When I say the criterion is objective and valid, I'm using both words interchangeably. Objective as in, factually right and valid.

This disagreement is happening only because you're delusional and cannot accept clear facts and logic that I've explained. You disagreeing doesnt change the objective fact that I am right. And no, I wouldnt be the best sports-bettor in the world because again, theres a fundamental difference between knowing what team is favoured, and knowing what team is gonna win.

We're talking about how to know what teams are favoured, not whether the favoured team would actually win or not, so the results by sports bettors compared to my 'favoured teams' results do not matter whatsoever. Regardless of results during the EMEA challengers, the factual criterion remains that certain teams are obviously favoured. Do note, though, that not ALL matchups have favoured teams obviously. Only some of them do.

So now you're shifting the argument into your own example to fit your argument, without even admitting the fact that my example proves my argument. Team A in my example is #1 in every aspect, so my example still stands and factually proves my argument. I'll entertain your example though. Even if Team A is strong in one aspect but weak in another, it wouldnt matter, they still were able to take down the best teams in the league, and have never lost. The fact of the matter is that Team A's SIGNIFICANT record of winning and never losing a single match yet proves that even though they were weak in that one aspect it doesnt matter, all their other strengths cover up for it. Team A are still the favourites. And also, this example of yours isnt realistic at all in the real world. Teams that dominate would never have 'one very weak aspect' otherwise they most likely wouldnt be able to dominate. Also, again, I'm doing this just to entertain you, I don't even have to, because you haven't countered my example which proves my argument. Your example doesn't disprove anything at all, either. I dont have to do by your definition of favourite either, theres no specific reason that ur definition would matter at all.

C9B fans come,General Discussion,"""Let's wait a bit before chimping out and calling each other delusional. What I mean when I say whether a criterion is invalid is, that the criterion cannot reliably predict the outcome, because fundamentally; that outcome is out of the hands of the person evaluating the data. Why I bring up sports betting as an objective measure is, because it is the most reliable objective measure we have for predicting whether a team is favored or not."" Did I ever state that the criterion could predict the outcome of the match? No, your premise is false. I stated that the best criterion FOR JUDGING THE 'FAVOURED' TEAM, keyword FAVOURED team TO WIN, is to look at past results. Obviously you can only tell whether a team is favoured in a match up, not whether they would actually win. That's not what this argument is about. ""There are more factors, than just match history to consider and weigh. How you measure how impressive a team's given record is requires assumptions to which there is no valid criterion. There exist objective and subjective criterion for this, but no valid criterion."" what does this even mean? Match history is obviously the only valid criterion. There are no assumptions required to assert that a team's record at Iceland like Sentinels was factually perfect, thats not an assumption, yet its measuring, objectively ,the teams record. Envy, at the playoffs, really good, consistent, got 4th. Thats a fact, there are no assumptions needing to be made about the impressiveness of their result and consistency. The valid criterion is the results in itself, its as simple as that. This is a fact, if you deny it, again, you are delusional. ""On vlr.gg gen.g was higher ranked, than andbox; on thespike.gg their ranking has andbox ranked higher, than gen.g. These are both objective criterion based on match history(and some other things), but neither of them are valid, as they do not predict future outcomes. Another objective criterion is to look at an aggregate of bettor opinions, which is what sports betting websites do. This gives a quantitative ratio between the people who think team A will win and people who think team B will win(with money bet of course). This measurement correlates better with the outcome of the game, than any ELO system, game record or other measure(if it didn't, that system would equalize the odds and it would). Therefore, objectively it is a better predictor of which team is favored over the other. This does not make it valid, but it makes it a more reliable predictor, because it outperforms any other objective measure we know of."" LMAO. what a bad example, to back up your even worse argument. Everyone with a brain knows that VLR rankings are trash, and invalid in every way. Therefore they cannot be used as any criterion, they are not objective nor valid. You cannot compare VLR rankings to match history at all lmao, because match history shows actual results in which you can factually determine the best teams in NA based on results, and not some funky invalid ELO VLR ranking. Bettor opinions again dont mean anything, they dont make a team favoured, they are not a valid criterion like match history is. Your entire premise is just so flawed, because I've never stated that there is any valid criterion for determining the outcome of a match, only for what team would be favoured. Objectively the best criterion for favoured team, is again, match results. You are delusional if you deny this. ""The measure you are using is subective(your own judgement of the teams records' & what importance it holds), rather than a quantified systemic aggregate of the opinions of many people, which is what sports betting odds are. So no, what you are proposing isn't ""factually right""; it is in fact your own subjective evaluation."" No, it is not subjective because anyone with a brain would realize that a team like Sentinels would be favoured against a team like Soniqs. Once again, not because of betting, or vlr rankings, but because of match history and accomplishments. What type of retarded fucking logic are you trying to use right now? Its not my 'own judgement' of the teams records and the importance of it, its objective, if a team like soniqs wins a small NSG monthly against tier 2 teams and a team like Sentinels wins Masters 2 against the best teams in the world, obviously objectively sentinels results are much more impressive and accomplished? It is a fact, not an opinion. Your logic is completely flawed. I'm factually right, you're simply delusional, and I've explained why. ""The objective in mind is predicting which team is favored to win. The objective measure you can use to measure how good a system is at predicting which team is favored over the other is to simply take the ratio of what predictions you made and how many of them were correct. There's a difference between calling a criterion objective and valid. To call a criterion objective means, that the criterion can quantify the objective with some sort of system. To call a criterion valid means, that the criterion must be a valid predictor of the objective. The objective being prediction of which team is favored to win. If there existed a valid criterion, then this disagreement wouldn't happen and you'd be the best sports-bettor in the world."" When I say the criterion is objective and valid, I'm using both words interchangeably. Objective as in, factually right and valid. The criterion of match results definitely predicts what team is favoured, as I've explained with the sen vs sq example. This disagreement is happening only because you're delusional and cannot accept clear facts and logic that I've explained. You disagreeing doesnt change the objective fact that I am right. And no, I wouldnt be the best sports-bettor in the world because again, theres a fundamental difference between knowing what team is favoured, and knowing what team is gonna win. You can NEVER know what team will win, that proposes knowing the future, which is impossible. But you can definitely factually know what team is favoured to win, based on match results, stats, and achievements. ""There exist many objective criterion, but no valid one. Your criterion is a subjective one based on your own observation and analysis of the match history. The vlr.gg/thespike.gg rankings are objective criterion based on ranking algorithms, which take in the teams' match histories. To evaluate which criterion is more reliable, all you need to do is calculate which criterion has the highest success-rate. To end, I challenge you to prove, that your subjective evaluation of teams' histories will outperform the aggregate opinions of sports bettors. I'll write down the pre-match odds for each game in the European challengers qualifier playoffs and you'll make your prediction in the comments and we'll see whether your subjective assessment outperform the odds produced by sports bettors."" delusional, once again. My criterion isnt subjective, its factually objective. And I dont have to prove that my criterion is factual because I've already proved it above. We're talking about how to know what teams are favoured, not whether the favoured team would actually win or not, so the results by sports bettors compared to my 'favoured teams' results do not matter whatsoever. Regardless of results during the EMEA challengers, the factual criterion remains that certain teams are obviously favoured. Do note, though, that not ALL matchups have favoured teams obviously. Only some of them do. Like if we were to do a 100T vs Envy again, theres no clear favourite, both are extremely close, and you could argue for either one because of how close their previous match was.",Canada,3,5/7/2021,10:19,5/7/2021,7:53

Fnatic is probably not as good as some other teams in EU right now.

But if fnatic redeem themselves, stomp G2, obviously it was a fluke. Playstyles and what not still dont matter, what matters is match results and accomplishments.

That is objective and factually analyzing it. The idea that you have to use mathematical notations to calculate an exact percentage is completely factually false, that is not at all required to determine what team is favoured. It's just common sense, you are overcomplicating it. We all know that Masters and VCT is the highest tier of tournament, and its obviously much more important than NSG weeklys.

Bad days are very rare, which is why they're bad days. If a team has a 'lot of bad days' then obviously they arent bad days, but rather the team is consistently bad.

Soniqs has always been tier 2, and still is tier 2. What do you mean its bc they ran into sentinels? That has nothing to do with it, even if they didnt go against sentinels, they obviously wouldnt have qualified to any closed qualifiers. They're a consistent tier 2 team and have never beaten a tier 1 team. They couldnt even beat TSM, which is at the very bottom of tier 1, bordering tier 2. Soniqs are still definitely tier 2.

""Their match results still look like shit because it's all renegades and shit but like there's no way to actually recognize that that is potential unless you actually watch those matches and analyze that Soniqs legitimately played it well."" They look like shit because they are shit. They lose to many tier 2 teams, not just renegades, you're clearly over compensating for your trashy argument by creating narratives out of thin air which aren't backed by actual stats. Please do more research. Soniqs played well in some matches sure, but again, against tier 2 teams. And even then, they still lost to tier 2 teams MANY times. There is no 'potential' that is hidden to us lmao. ""Like NRG can also 13-0 a lot of the teams in tier 2 probably. But they probably are much worse than Soniqs at the moment. Maybe my logic is pretty bad considering that I'm freewriting this. But your use of match results isn't objective. Nothing really is. And sports betters do use match results and feats. And they're usually better than us at this. That's the reason why betting odds are a pretty good way at finding the favored team."" Theres no proof at all that they are worse than Soniqs, but there's also no proof to suggest they're better than Soniqs. Right now, NRG is an uncharted team, we have no way of knowing whether they will be tier 1 or tier 2, or whether their loss against virtuoso was even an upset. We have yet to see, if they will improve, which they likely will. This still has nothing to do with the argument at hand, obviously NRG is uncharted territory, they have a new roster, which doesnt justify their performance in terms of results, of course, but is still the most likely explanation for their poor performance. And again, match ressults are definitely objective and factual. I've explained why. If you deny this, you're delusional. You can deny it all you want, but it doesn't change the objective validity of my argument. I've debunked your argument thoroughly. Sports betters are not reliable.",Canada,-2,5/7/2021,24:08,5/7/2021,7:53

Estimating is biased. Ask anyone in statistics as well. Everything is biased. But saying your common sense is less subjective than a ton of sport betters. Is possible. But I'd highly doubt it. Betters also watch the matches. So they also see how they play so they can spot much more factors than just match results. So yea. And also Soniqs only lost 13 times while they've won 80 times. That's really good. That's even better than sentinels record. I don't know where you're getting that Soniqs lost many times in the tier 2 scene. When they're pretty much dominating it. While renegades(one of the biggest t2 teams) have a record of 15-48. That's around 68% while soniqs is 86%. But many would consider that info useless because they're only fighting tier 2 teams. But the fact is that they're actually playing really well. And that they're probably above tier 1.5 right now and can easily be tier 1 if they faced another team. If they faced another team. Your match results would be absolute shit but the betters who are willing to bet. Probably also watch tier 2 games because they are invested enough to bet.

C9B fans come,General Discussion,"Fuuuck. I had a 6 paragraph essay to write but then I accidentally pressed the back button on my thumb button. Well I guess I'll just rewrite it. The 35% of elders in America statistic is also biased. Everything is. At least according to statistics. Because it would be biased depending on the age group. The selection of adults. The location. And even more in the math of it. Literally everything is biased. And I find it hard to believe that your estimation is objective if even statistics aren't. Dw I don't think covid is a lie but all statistics aren't objective. So another problem is that. Assumptions aren't objective. A quick first way to understand why. Is by using a real life example. Such as. A white man from the 1800s(NOT CURRENT, CURRENT PEOPLE ARE LESS RACISTS) sees a black man on the streets. Even though the black man is wearing casual clothes. The white man would still believe the black man is poor. This is probably as simple to them as the sky is blue or the soil on the ground is yucky to eat. I don't believe this racism is justified by any means. But common sense isn't perfect. Especially when it's by only one individual. Now let's talk about why Assumptions aren't objective from a scientific point of view. So the thing is that nothing is actually objective. Observations are just assumptions as well. Such as eyesight or even the fact that the earth is round. Because there’s no true way to prove it. That’s why all things in science are called theorems. Because they are always built off of some core assumptions. Such as in quantum physics. There is parity symmetry. But 2 types of parity symmetry were disproven before which made a decade of research irrelevant. This is possible for anything. But our emotions believe that what we see is what we see. It might not even be real. Honestly we could be in a simulation but I’m not that much of a weirdo even though I’m atheist. And I don’t really like to concern myself with that kind of philosophy. And even in mathematics the only two very objective(not completely objective) forms of mathematics are set theory and geometry, specifically Euclidean Geometry. So what is set theory. It’s the theory that everything in this world can be categorized inside a set. But that’s also an assumption so that’s why it’s also technically not objective but also they had another problem. When you put sets inside sets. Shit didn’t work. So they had to make a rule that sets couldn’t contain other sets. And when you put this together and these 2 rules. It takes like 20 pages to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. Like common sense can be objective. But it’s not objective through common sense. It’s objective through other means. And Euclidean Geometry bases itself off 5 basic postulates which we already determined that assumptions are not objective which makes this already slightly subjective but. Yea everything is made sure that it doesn’t have any other assumptions that these 5 postulates. That’s why it’s so hard to disprove. Because the 5 basic postulates have never been disproved. That’s why it can be considered objective while statistics can’t be. Now why does this connect to Common Sense. Well common sense is our basic ability to judge something. That’s an assumption. And it’s very often built off an assumption that could be one day disproven. Common Sense can be objective. But it’s not always objective. And common sense is not what makes it objective. So.

A team being favoured is not an assumption, it is a fact. If the white man believed that the black man was poor, that doesnt necessarily mean he was racist wtf?

There is no proof at all otherwise, and the 'simulation' argument doesnt apply at all, because 1. theres no proof of it, and 2. even if it were a simulation, it would still objectively exist in our simulation, which would be our reality. So even if this is a 'fake world' it is still our reality, and therefore we measure things to be objective based on how it is in our world. Obviously you cant fucking realize how things might work out in a 'real world' if this is a simulation, which is why thats not how it works; you define facts and objective scientific discoveries based on our reality which we know to be true.

It is impossible to disprove. Statistics are inherently objective, but not factual. The difference being, statistics largely dont have any 'opinions' or 'emotions' involved in them. They're just data pieces, and numbers. Again, that doesnt mean they're factual, because there's no actual proof that they're factual.

My criterion isnt subjective, its factually objective. And I dont have to prove that my criterion is factual because I've already proved it above. We're talking about how to know what teams are favoured, not whether the favoured team would actually win or not, so the results by sports bettors compared to my 'favoured teams' results do not matter whatsoever. Regardless of results during the EMEA challengers, the factual criterion remains that certain teams are obviously favoured. Do note, though, that not ALL matchups have favoured teams obviously.

C9B fans come,General Discussion,"Here the part 2 ""You can't define ""favored"" as outcome-independent, because you cannot verify whether that team was actually favored or not and objectively measure the performance of the criterion. This is where you are going wrong. You are just asserting your criterion is ""factual"" without providing any empirical evidence."" What? Of course you can? If you have Sentinels vs Soniqs, Sentinels are the clear favourite, but its POSSIBLE that soniqs could win. Its not IMPOSSIBLE, its just HIGHLY unlikely. And again, as I have stated, its determined from match results that sentinels are the favourites. The criterion is factual, and I've explained how. There is no 'empirical evidence' involved here though either? You clearly do not understand what you are talking about. When people talk about things, they use logic, logic IS the root of facts, it IS what determines what is factual or not. I've logically and factually proven you wrong. ""The entire objective of saying whether a team is favored or not is to predict whether that team will be more likely to win or not. That is literally what you imply in your posts as well, you say it's an upset, that gen.g won, when you thought andbox were clearly favored prior to the game starting. So you had outcomes in your mind, an upset and an expected win. Just like sports betting websites have odds for how likely the bettors think each team is to win. These things can be measured and compared with success-rates."" Exactly, which team will be more likely to win. Andbox were OBJECTIVELY favoured to win, based on their results, they were factually the better team based on results before the match-up. Again, sports betting is not reliable as match results. Match results are ALWAYS factual and right for favoured matchups, sports betting is not always accurate. ""You said you cannot with certainty predict, which team can win at any given moment(which I agree with), but you said you can know which team is favored to win. This doesn't make sense, you cannot know either in this case, but you can make guesses to both based on your methods. If you knew, that a coin you are tossing is 1/3rd likely to hit tails and 2/3rd likely to hit heads, then knowing for certain the outcome of a single toss doesn't matter. You can make many tosses with that coin and measure which side it is more likely to land on and make a prediction with that data. In Valorant we don't know either, we can only make educated guesses as to which one it is through various methods which have a varying success rate, none of which are valid."" It does make sense, because any team can win at any given time. However, this does not change the objective fact that a certain team was FAVOURED to win, and MORE LIKELY to win. Your analogy makes no sense, if you knew that the coin is 2/3rd likely to hit heads then obviously heads would be FAVOURED and more LIKELY to be landed on. That is a fact, as that is the higher probability. Your analogy didn't prove your argument at all, and it's pretty sad, and funny, to think about the fact that you probably think it was clever; it wasn't.

Your criterion is a subjective one based on your own observation and analysis of the match history. The vlr.gg/thespike.gg rankings are objective criterion based on ranking algorithms, which take in the teams' match histories. To evaluate which criterion is more reliable, all you need to do is calculate which criterion has the highest success-rate. To end, I challenge you to prove, that your subjective evaluation of teams' histories will outperform the aggregate opinions of sports bettors. I'll write down the pre-match odds for each game in the European challengers qualifier playoffs and you'll make your prediction in the comments and we'll see whether your subjective assessment outperform the odds produced by sports bettors."" delusional, once again. My criterion isnt subjective, its factually objective. And I dont have to prove that my criterion is factual because I've already proved it above. We're talking about how to know what teams are favoured, not whether the favoured team would actually win or not, so the results by sports bettors compared to my 'favoured teams' results do not matter whatsoever. Regardless of results during the EMEA challengers, the factual criterion remains that certain teams are obviously favoured. Do note, though, that not ALL matchups have favoured teams obviously. Only some of them do. Like if we were to do a 100T vs Envy again, theres no clear favourite, both are extremely close, and you could argue for either one because of how close their previous match was.",Philippines,-1,5/7/2021,22:07,5/7/2021,7:53

PRX fans come,General Discussion,"Be real, no bias Do you think Something is better than F0rsaken at the Jett?

PRX fans come,General Discussion,"I really enjoyed seeing f0rsaken play Jett in Tokyo again (his Jett before the Chamber meta was an absolute menace with his raw aim and game sense), man showed why his Jett was still world class, but something's Jett feels more dynamic in his movement and the way he fluctuates between OP, vandal, knives and shotguns. It's funny how something always say ""don't die"" to his teammates but he's always the first one to overheat and overextend, getting killed without being able to be traded. That being said, I think paper rex in general last year doesn't have that discipline compared to this year, so saying something doesn't have the discipline isn't fair when the whole team last year without him was mostly hitting W - even Jinggg is still swinging and pushing without actually needing to do so, and getting away with it.",Singapore,2,20/8/2023,19:21,20/8/2023,18:41
PRX fans come,General Discussion,F0rsaken jett peak was when jett has pre nerf dash. If you see his games in 2021 until masters reykjavik his movement is insane and he cam make dumb and aggressive plays. After nerf he was not the same ,Indonesia,1,20/8/2023,19:45,20/8/2023,18:41

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"I see so many people on HLTV act like csgo is somehow harder than valorant,but its just not.The main arguments i see that are being used are the fact that valorant has slower movement then cs(therefore making hitting your shots easier) and easier utility usage (since cs has only 5 pieces of utility,compared to valorant which has a fuckton).But this logic relies on the argument that easier mechanics=easier game,which is a completely flawed way of thinking.Just because its easier to use utility in valorant,doesnt make the entire game easier,because this advantage doesnt only apply to you,it also applies to your enemies.Therefore,because of valorants countless ways of being creative in terms of utility usage you have to be 10 times more aware of things such as positioning,because there are countless ways the enemies can kill you without even having to face you.Sure that also can be said about cs but still if you are in a bad position in a csgo game its nowhere near as punishable as it is in a valorant game.Having an easier time using utlity=having a harder time positioning yourself in a productive way,and having a harder time predicting what your enemies are going to do.Same can be said about valorants slower movement,you are not the only one having an easier time hitting shots,your enemies have the same advantage and therefore therefore it doesnt make the game easier compared to cs,it just means those 2 games have similar mechanics distributed in a different way.And the final argument i see thats being used,is that the valorant pro scene is made up of washed up cs pros.Now where do i begin with this one,first of all Valorant is a new game and its completely logical that its playerbase consists of csgo,apex,fortnite players.There is no ,,original valorant player"" because if someone never touched an fps game until valorant came out its impossible to go from being clueless about fps's to pro in just 2 years.And if we stay and look at all the csgo pros who switched to valorant,most of them failed to stay relevant in the scene.Some of them never came close to being good in valorant(happy,skadoodle,dazed,swag,floppy,autimatic) ,others were good at the beginning of the game but once the scene started to develop and other teams started catching up they fell from tier 1 and altough they are still good they are nowhere near the best (sentinels squad,scream,jamppi,zellsis,wippie) and others managed to become way more relevant in valorant then they ever were in cs(boaster,fns,victor,ange1,nukkye) .The point is,its completely normal for the valorant scene to be made of pros of ex something,cause its impossible to go from knowing nothing to mastery in just 2 years,so its obvious those that have experiences of games similar to valorant will have an advantage to those who dont,especially if we are talking about pros here.So being good at cs is not a guarantee you will be good in valorant,because csgo is not a harder game than valorant is,both games have their own mechanics distributed in completely different ways so when it comes to playing professionally,there is no harder game.",Croatia,8,25/4/2022,9:21,25/4/2022,9:21

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"I see so many people on HLTV act like csgo is somehow harder than valorant,but its just not.The main arguments i see that are being used are the fact that valorant has slower movement then cs(therefore making hitting your shots easier) and easier utility usage (since cs has only 5 pieces of utility,compared to valorant which has a fuckton).But this logic relies on the argument that easier mechanics=easier game,which is a completely flawed way of thinking.Just because its easier to use utility in valorant,doesnt make the entire game easier,because this advantage doesnt only apply to you,it also applies to your enemies.Therefore,because of valorants countless ways of being creative in terms of utility usage you have to be 10 times more aware of things such as positioning,because there are countless ways the enemies can kill you without even having to face you.Sure that also can be said about cs but still if you are in a bad position in a csgo game its nowhere near as punishable as it is in a valorant game.Having an easier time using utlity=having a harder time positioning yourself in a productive way,and having a harder time predicting what your enemies are going to do.Same can be said about valorants slower movement,you are not the only one having an easier time hitting shots,your enemies have the same advantage and therefore therefore it doesnt make the game easier compared to cs,it just means those 2 games have similar mechanics distributed in a different way.And the final argument i see thats being used,is that the valorant pro scene is made up of washed up cs pros.Now where do i begin with this one,first of all Valorant is a new game and its completely logical that its playerbase consists of csgo,apex,fortnite players.There is no ,,original valorant player"" because if someone never touched an fps game until valorant came out its impossible to go from being clueless about fps's to pro in just 2 years.And if we stay and look at all the csgo pros who switched to valorant,most of them failed to stay relevant in the scene.Some of them never came close to being good in valorant(happy,skadoodle,dazed,swag,floppy,autimatic) ,others were good at the beginning of the game but once the scene started to develop and other teams started catching up they fell from tier 1 and altough they are still good they are nowhere near the best (sentinels squad,scream,jamppi,zellsis,wippie) and others managed to become way more relevant in valorant then they ever were in cs(boaster,fns,victor,ange1,nukkye) .The point is,its completely normal for the valorant scene to be made of pros of ex something,cause its impossible to go from knowing nothing to mastery in just 2 years,so its obvious those that have experiences of games similar to valorant will have an advantage to those who dont,especially if we are talking about pros here.So being good at cs is not a guarantee you will be good in valorant,because csgo is not a harder game than valorant is,both games have their own mechanics distributed in completely different ways so when it comes to playing professionally,there is no harder game.",Bosnia and Herzegovina,-2,25/4/2022,9:33,25/4/2022,9:21

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"I disagree pretty hard. For one thing not every valorant agent has the same escape capabilities as everyone in csgo has. In csgo everyone has a molly, flash, and smoke, so if you get stuck somewhere it's pretty easy to just popflash or smoke out. Compare that to iv you're playing Killjoy or something and get stuck. You have far less that gives you the chance to escape also in CSGO the movement is faster so it's easier to swing and shoot someone before they have time to react",United States,0,28/4/2022,10:19,25/4/2022,9:21

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"Uhm, no? In CS you have to learn line ups for absolutely everything. Smokes, mollies, nades, flashes, everything. Every Iron player in Valorant can smoke off entrances to a site perfectly within seconds. In CS you probably have to learn at least 3 line ups per entrance depending on where you are currently on the map. You need one for standard T-Side, one or two for flank T-Side and one for post plant T-Side & that’s just for one of the entrances on one site on a map. Not even talking about CT side here where it’s even worse bc a good player needs to know line ups for various different spots that he is either hiding in or was forced to fall back to + all the T-Side smokes bc you need to rotate quite a bit, sometimes thru T-spawn or other parts of the map that aren’t CT. Sure, you can play without knowing any of that, but if you want to play at a higher level it’s absolutely needed. Valorant is the easier game, no question about it. That’s the entire business model of Riot. Take beloved, difficult esports titles & create an easier, more accessible copy of it. That doesn’t mean it’s worse, just means it’s not as hard.",Austria,1,25/4/2022,19:46,25/4/2022,9:21

Once again rellying on the same argument that easier mechanics=easier game.Thats just not true because the easier the utility usage is,the harder it will be for you to predict how enemies are going to use their utlity and therefore positioning is way harder and more punishable in valorant",Croatia,3,25/4/2022,20:51,25/4/2022,9:21

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"""Valorant has slower movement"" - It's easier to hit pixel shots in CS than Valorant because when you fast wide peek, it's almost impossible to reactively flick the shot. Pros tried it and they miss a lot. ""Run and gun"" - Yes running and gunning happens but thats due to the random bullet tracers of guns like the spectre with low recoil but bigger spread. You cannot run and gun all game without stopping for kills so that's overexaggerated and something that is very rare in pro play and higher elo. "" Too many clown abilities"" - That's what makes Valorant unique, the ability to be a tactical shooter with movement mechanics and agent spice.

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"as someone who enjoys playing both of them, i'd say theyre both fun games. But as for difficulty, i have to give it to csgo. But valorant wins the enjoyment In valorant, you can easily smoke anything you want with agents like omen or brimstone and create super easy popflashes using phoenix, yoru or even reyna because you can see where your flashes are going with the tracers behind the walls n stuff. Csgo requires you to be creative with nades or learn lineups. I'm only gold nova 2 in cs but i'm forced to learn nade lineups on every map i play. Plus, the spray control and bhopping is definitely harder If i had to choose one to play for the rest of my life, I'd choose valorant hands down, because Riot actively develops the game, adds new features and fixes bugs. Also you can get creative with the skills and agents, whereas csgo starts to feel very repetitive after some time. Plus, it has a better anti cheat system.

CSGO is NOT harder than Valorant,General Discussion,"see so many people on HLTV act like csgo is somehow harder than valorant,but its just not.The main arguments i see that are being used are the fact that valorant has slower movement then cs(therefore making hitting your shots easier) and easier utility usage (since cs has only 5 pieces of utility,compared to valorant which has a fuckton).But this logic relies on the argument that easier mechanics=easier game,which is a completely flawed way of thinking.Just because its easier to use utility in valorant,doesnt make the entire game easier,because this advantage doesnt only apply to you,it also applies to your enemies.Therefore,because of valorants countless ways of being creative in terms of utility usage you have to be 10 times more aware of things such as positioning,because there are countless ways the enemies can kill you without even having to face you.Sure that also can be said about cs but still if you are in a bad position in a csgo game its nowhere near as punishable as it is in a valorant game.Having an easier time using utlity=having a harder time positioning yourself in a productive way,and having a harder time predicting what your enemies are going to do.Same can be said about valorants slower movement,you are not the only one having an easier time hitting shots,your enemies have the same advantage and therefore therefore it doesnt make the game easier compared to cs,it just means those 2 games have similar mechanics distributed in a different way.And the final argument i see thats being used,is that the valorant pro scene is made up of washed up cs pros.Now where do i begin with this one,first of all Valorant is a new game and its completely logical that its playerbase consists of csgo,apex,fortnite players.There is no ,,original valorant player"" because if someone never touched an fps game until valorant came out its impossible to go from being clueless about fps's to pro in just 2 years.And if we stay and look at all the csgo pros who switched to valorant,most of them failed to stay relevant in the scene.Some of them never came close to being good in valorant(happy,skadoodle,dazed,swag,floppy,autimatic) ,others were good at the beginning of the game but once the scene started to develop and other teams started catching up they fell from tier 1 and altough they are still good they are nowhere near the best (sentinels squad,scream,jamppi,zellsis,wippie) and others managed to become way more relevant in valorant then they ever were in cs(boaster,fns,victor,ange1,nukkye) .The point is,its completely normal for the valorant scene to be made of pros of ex something,cause its impossible to go from knowing nothing to mastery in just 2 years,so its obvious those that have experiences of games similar to valorant will have an advantage to those who dont,especially if we are talking about pros here.So being good at cs is not a guarantee you will be good in valorant,because csgo is not a harder game than valorant is,both games have their own mechanics distributed in completely different ways so when it comes to playing professionally,there is no harder game. posted 2 days ago",Finland,0,28/4/2022,5:19,25/4/2022,9:21

Where you there watching over his entire life? It is reasonable to believe that any person above 14 years of age knows what racism is and knows at least the basic slurs. Especially if you are competing in eSports. Also, come out of your NA bubble. People in other continents know the basics of multiple languages. Especially if you lived in one of those countries. Personally, I am from India, but I know what slurs Indos use against Filipinos and similar stuff. Most people are multilingual or at least partially understand other languages. I don't know if all the servers you get contain people with positive vibes and supportive in general. In video games, it is quite common to find an extremely racist/sexist/homophobe/islamophobe guy in 1/10 games. You guys putting the narrative that a person playing video games never came across such racist slurs being used is just too far-fetched especially when a lot of Brazilians here (and in general a known fact) that certain white Argentinians are racist against Brazilians.",India,5,9/8/2022,11:53,9/8/2022,6:26

Imagine getting a job in Japan and creating a ruckus in public. Or travelling to India and just casually ordering beef in a restaurant in a north Indian state. An Indian casually using the N-word in a western country for black men cause that is what our history books refer to them as. All of these things stems from cultural bias but are they cool? no. You might think this is cultural bias and you might not know any better but it is extremely uncomfortable/offensive to the people involved. Know who you are working with. Keznit competes/plays/scrims with Brazillian players. He has lived in Brazil He should know better. He should know what words can be offensive for others. If he does not, that is just ignorance and once again, it is not a trait you should defend him for. I agree with the fact that you should not take someone's career away for such accusations but a paid professional should try to fit better with other cultures if they are interacting with it.",India,0,9/8/2022,24:41,9/8/2022,6:26

Keznit racism in CS,General Discussion,"I didn't say he's racist because he's Argentinian or Chilean, I said that nobody recorded him being racist in his CS:GO days, because it was common, and it's a waste of time because Valve totally ignores it on the SA servers. Interpret it correctly. And I don't see why more than one pro CS:GO player, who has nothing to do with Valorant, would lie about him being racist in Gamers Club matches, etc.",Brazil,-2,10/8/2022,24:12,9/8/2022,6:26
Keznit racism in CS,General Discussion,"And that circles back to the problem at hand, there is no proof of it. I can see your points and I don’t doubt that there are racists in CS, since video gaming is a cesspool that attracts all kinds of people, but without the proof that a pro player is racist, it looks like the accusers are just crybabies at this point. It is not a good look for the fans of your region unfortunately, if they complain and try to defame a player with no solid proof. But people are entitled to their own opinion and will act regardless. Keznit is definitely an asshole and very immature but accusing him of racism for years with no footage leads to what you see today on the forums sadly.",United States,2,10/8/2022,24:21,9/8/2022,6:26
Keznit racism in CS,General Discussion,"Why am I going to show evidence if I'm not looking to prove anything in a COURT? I simply believe that the reports about keznit being racist in CS are real, as more than one Counter-Strike pro player has spoken about it. If you don't believe it, ok, that's your problem, but I believe it and I know that players who have nothing to do with Valorant wouldn't give these reports for nothing.

Keznit racism in CS,General Discussion,"U got it twisted my guy. This is not like a religion where people “believe” in something, that’s simply not how it works. This is a real life person and the fact of the matter is, he is either racist or not. Not whether you believe he is or not. THAT is why proof matters, otherwise people are slandering him for the wrong reasons. It’s really simple. No one ever mentioned court or any kind of legal process. I could accuse you of anything and if I believe it it doesn’t make it true. That is why people are calling out Brazil fans for witchhunting.",United States,3,10/8/2022,20:30,9/8/2022,6:26
Keznit racism in CS,General Discussion,"Yes, things work like that. More than one CS:GO player has given reports that he has been racist more than once.

Vast majority of people after putting a decent amount of critical thought into the situation and thinking without letting sensationalism from either side get to them, arrive at the same conclusion, sure, the guy's been toxic and immature, but the racism accusations are baseless, ridiculous and sensationalized to self-victimize and create more and more pitchfork bullshit against an specific player because of a stupid fixation against him. get out of you little bubble Shidoh, you're worrying. you're attacking me for making a comment supporting the BR community... that should make you realize how fucked you are lol you claim to know your country because of a little bubble hatred shitty community you have, meanwhile a fuckton of brazilians i've spoken to both in-person and online have said what I stated after actual debates and thought, as opposed to baseless crying as you're accustomed to. big weirdo",Venezuela,6,9/8/2022,7:07,9/8/2022,6:26

Again we have a problem with keznit, in both moments (monkey clip, and cj acident) he made two statements that we can clearly put as racial injury, and the brazilian community did what? screams, hate, death threads and all. at the end what we've gain is everyone agains us in every possible situation. disclaimer: dg was idiot at calling mazino slow. but not comparable, at least for me. disclaimer2: my english is a bit broken, trying my best, corrections will be very lovely",Brazil,4,9/8/2022,7:14,9/8/2022,6:26

I'm not sure what other fans feel, but now that GenG has taken the first Pacific trophy I kinda want PRX to continue playing with their own style, not the braindead W gaming but the ones we saw back in Champs last year, really good utility usage, playing as a team, making their weird comps actually work in their favour.

What is limiting PRX?,General Discussion,"I don't watch PRX and Pacific but i think their problem is adapting to the meta and copying from other teams. You can't copy everything from other teams and expect to win because the players are different and PRX has a unique style but still if GenG won the last Masters that means they are doing most of the things perfect.

What is limiting PRX?,General Discussion,"First of all, does prx require a roster changes? If not then change the coach. I had always thought that PRX should replace ""mindfreak"" with another controller.

What is limiting PRX?,General Discussion,"1 Their mental is still somehow weak , this has to be addressed, imo they should hire a good sports psychologist like Fnatic has done. Jinggs inability to flex ( as he thought he was finally gonna retire) and play only raze or sage or pheonix ( which is currently barely playable on the current map pool) but this wasn't their own fault considering that initially monyet was gonna be the player and his agent pool was wider, thus they had already dedicated the entire off season to playing with monyet agent pool where the team has much better flex ability. Their map pool is also poor because of the same above reason where they prolly had better comps for maps which they currently suck on in the office season with monyet agent pool.",India,0,13/7/2024,23:30,13/7/2024,20:39

What is limiting PRX?,General Discussion,"something people don't seem to mention today is that they went for their very comfort picks on both maps despite knowing A) They've gotten anti stratted on these comps plenty of times before B) Its against GenG, a team that knows them better than anyone else despite weeks and multiple matches of experimenting (especially on ascent) various roles and comps. I'm not someone to huff copium thinking they're ""hiding strats"", its completely possible that they thought those experiments didnt lead to anything fruitful but its still weird to see them not even trying anything different knowing what they've been pulling in previous matches. also yea, jinggg agent pool is an issue; love the guy but i dont understand why he doesnt play sova when im pretty sure thats his 3rd most played agent after raze and reyna, maybe alecks thinks putting him on sova is a waste of firepower? but he wasnt even shooting all that well today anyway",Nepal,0,13/7/2024,23:41,13/7/2024,20:39

STATS mwzera  cNed  TenZ  DEATHMATCH STATS mwzera - 86% win rate (thats the insaniest thing ive seen in a while) cNed - stats not availiable TenZ - 73% win rate RANKED STATS mwzera - 66.3% winrate (MVP of 95% of the matches) proof here  cNed - 53.5% winrate (MVP of 13% of the matches) TenZ - 60.4% winrate (MVP of 15% of the matches) can you take your time to appreciate how insane mwzera is? without a doubt the most talented player to ever touch the game I'll try to explain briefly why I think he is the best player in the world Despite his insane aim and movement The best way to know if a player is a good duelist is RAZE. There is a BIG difference between a good duelist and a jett abuser If he is a good duelist, he needs to be good with raze. heat? not good with raze aspas? not good with raze xand? not good with raze tenz? not good with raze cned? not good with raze scream? not good with raze d3ffo? not good with raze derke? not good with raze Thats why I think he is undoubtely the best player in the world. If RIOT by any means decides to nerf jett and shift the meta we prolly not gonna even hear names like cned and tenz again :> He is not killing 40+ per map because when he joined VK he was forced to play a different role because heat is already a main jett... and lets be honest, every single duelist nowadays gets 20+ kills per map because team and setups are basically built around you (even steel managed to get 20 kills with it",Zimbabwe,0,8/4/2023,22:29,8/4/2023,22:29

New scandal in Korean Esports,General Discussion,"You can see the whole thing in English for yourself here -  TLDR - a Korean Esports player allegedly had consensual sex with a girl and non-consensually ejaculated inside of her. On top of that he did some other wrongdoings, cheated on the said person etc SOME KOREAN FANS SPECULATE THAT THE SAID ESPORTS PLAYER IS A MEMBER OF DRX VALORANT. I DON'T HAVE 100% CONFIRMATION ABOUT THIS INFORMATION, BUT MULTIPLE PEOPLE SAID THAT THIS PERSON PLAYS FOR DRX VALORANT. Since we don't have 100% confirmation, I don't want you guys to jump to conclusions, but just keep it in mind. If I get more info on the matter, I'll keep you updated. Just wanted to share this information because this fucked up shit has no place in Esports community. All updates - The person is CONFIRMED to be a Valorant player. Victim claims that there are also other victims who haven't spoken out YET -  update by OP-  she says that - ""Due to Korean law, I can't say anything in public. I'm sorry. I want to make sure that I know the players and the team, but I'm being sued by Korean law."" ""I'm at a disadvantage under Korean law and I'm careful what I say because it's a bad situation. I don't think it'll take long to solve it. I'll try my best to solve it and let you know"" I assume that she's talking about the strict defamation laws of Korea. She also KNOWS the player and the team but can't outright speak out due to the strict laws. the said perpetrator deleted his Discord server earlier - only one person matches that description. IMPORTANT NOTE - the victim is asking to stop harassing her, spreading hate and victim blaming.",South Korea,42,23/7/2024,23:15,23/7/2024,23:15

Especially in cases like this where, from my understanding, there was consensual sex, but further boundaries were broken without consent. You would essentially need a confession post-hoc, or a recording of them while you say no (in the US, sometimes these recordings aren't even admissible in court). The court of public opinion doesn't need to meet those same legal standards, and can often be a good alternative to get justice.

New scandal in Korean Esports,General Discussion,"From what I’ve read, it probably wouldn’t be classified as rape if, for example, Flashback was the one who did it. I’m basing that off of this paragraph: “In South Korea, sexual activity with a person under the age of 16 (in international age, not ""Korean age"") is considered statutory rape, unless the other party is under 19. Sex with a child under 13 is considered statutory rape under all circumstances. Prior to 2020 the age of consent in South Korea was 13.” I’m not saying this makes it ok, and the “internal ejaculation” without consent part is definitely not ok, but perhaps the age difference was not a concern for the people involved. The other stuff (cheating, attitude) isn’t really worthy of a scandal on its own.",United States,-5,24/7/2024,12:49,23/7/2024,23:15

They were also in a relationship and had consensual intercourse, however the internal ejaculation is where the problem lies. That was not consensual, coupled with the fact that she is a minor. Can any korean confirm what age you become an adult over there since idk That coupled with the fact that he apparently cheated on the victim is all the information I know. The team was aware of this, and had spoken to the victim b4 about it, they said that the player would be removed from the organization upon her request.

New scandal in Korean Esports,General Discussion,"NOTICE Hello, this is DRX. We have recently confirmed private events related to one of our players have surfaced online. Upon becoming aware of the severity of this issue, we immediately initiated an investigation to ascertain the facts and determine any legal violations. At the time of this statement, no illegal activities have been discovered. The investigation is still ongoing and will continue until the matter is fully resolved; and if necessary, DRX will fully cooperate with external agencies to take further actions. The player deeply regrets causing any ethical concerns as a professional esports athlete and is fully cooperating with the investigation. Until the ongoing investigation is officially closed, we kindly ask everyone to refrain from spreading any false information and/or making defamatory statements. In particular, any baseless actions with the purpose to defame the player - resulting in damages - will be considered for legal actions according to the player's wishes. DRX is and will always be committed to remain a team that fans can continue to trust and support. Thank you. DRX Corp. The author spread unconfirmed facts as if they were facts. You made Flashback a rapist, and you are not responsible for that. This is truly a piece of shit.",United Kingdom,0,26/7/2024,12:57,23/7/2024,23:15

New scandal in Korean Esports,General Discussion,"you're right. The person who posted the current post made a ridiculous remark about being a “rapist” for an incident that has not yet been clearly revealed, and if it is really “rape,” you can go to the police station and have them legally judged. However, the exposer cannot actually go to the police station. because?

New scandal in Korean Esports,General Discussion,"What I can currently say is Both the person who wrote the expose and the player being mentioned are legally “minors.” And the pair “had a consensual relationship.” This case is a matter between the two individuals. This is not something that goes so far as to call the player a “rapist.” And DRX is an Esports team that operates several sports. Last year, in DRX League of Legends, a player was exposed as a false pregnancy. In the end, the ex-girlfriend ran away after it was discovered that the ""pregnancy test"" was a fake photo taken from Google. At that time, the incident occurred and DRX spent the season without the club releasing a statement (the revelation occurred at the beginning of the season). During that time, the players, team, and fans had a really difficult time. Therefore, I have a “neutral” view of this incident. Following the DRX League of Legends player incident and the Sinatra player incident in VALORANT, I think the answer is to watch and wait ""neutrally"" rather than viewing this incident with regret from one side.",South Korea,5,26/7/2024,13:15,23/7/2024,23:15

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"ALLAT WARNING  Below is every falsifiable/verifiable claim from my masterpiece, in order A1. FNC had an 0-5 record vs zombs A2. Lock-In was a preseason tourney A3. Lock-In was meant to showcase the teams in the new franchising system A4. Lock-In had single elimination format A5. LOUD exchanged their two best performers from their champs run for rookies A6. The trophy broke A7. Liquid beat Fnatic at the end of the EMEA League A8. Fnatic won the first map vs NRG 13-9, and it was tied 6-6 at the half. A9. Ardiss had a 0.21 rating on the 2nd map (at the time it was written, with the new rating it actually fell to 0.16) A10. In the DRX 13-1 game vs Fnatic on Bind, Boaster had 0 kills until the final round and a 0.44 rating (at the time it was written, 0.31 with the new rating system) A11. PRX played Tokyo with a pubg streamer instead of the Pacific MVP Something, due to visa issues A12. With something, PRX outperformed FNC at the next three events after Tokyo (Champs 23, Madrid, Shanghai) A13. At Champs 23, PRX made Grand Finals, beating EG in upper finals and LOUD along the way A14. FNC did not attend Madrid, and PRX beat both teams that outperformed Fnatic for those slots A15. At Shanghai, PRX beat EDG and lost (super closely) to 100T A16. At Shanghai, FNC were winless A17. PRX beat GEN.G domestically A18. FNC lost to FUT at shanghai A19. At Tokyo, EG's Star player Demon1 had visa issues A20. Demon1's addition to EG's roster turned around their season A21. Demon1 would go on to be the Champs MVP A22. Due to Visa Issues, Demon1 was unable to practice with his team until a last minute return A23. Across every map played between EG and FNC in both series, the only maps that didn't come down to two rounds - which is the closest possible win margin in valorant - were Fracture for EG and Lotus for Fnatic Below is every claim that was implied or inferred. These are points that are not statements of fact in and of themselves and are ultimately subjective, but are directly supported or reached by reasoning from evidence above. B1. Fnatic's first run, in which they made finals and played two close series in a respectable attempt, was their best achievement pre-franchising. This run ultimately had an 0-5 record vs zombs (A1) B2. They won Lock-In via a historic choke, which had something to do with swapping out 2 elite players with rookies (A5) B3. Riot didn't think Lock-In was an event as serious as/on par with Masters or Champions (A2 A3 A4) B4. The first map vs NRG was a fair, solid win, but they stomped the second in large part due to Ardiss trolling (A8 A9 A10) B5. PRX was significantly nerfed without Something, and there is strong evidence (for about a year straight) that suggested that they would've beaten FNC at Tokyo with him (A11 A12 A13 A14 A15 A16 A17 A18) B6. Similarly, EG was significantly nerfed by not being able to practice with Demon1 before the event, and there is strong evidence that suggested that they would have beaten FNC at Tokyo if not for that situation ( A19 A20 A21 A22 A23) Below is every pure opinion expressed, which are not directly backed up by verifiable claim C1 The rest of the EMEA was garbo leading to the hype train getting out of control - 'Name the 2nd best EMEA team of 23' and what they accomplished' C2. Liquid beating them was a fluke - I don't think I have to defend this C3. Having a 'hard' format doesn't by itself make an event prestigious or winning it a real achievement, or necessarily select for the best team - 'a random agent select tourney would be by far the hardest event ever hosted, doesn't change that winning it would be a cosmetic achievement, worthless in comparison to events with real formats and qualifiers (ie: designed to select for the best team)' C4. Saying they only could've lost to LOUD is just an excuse for why they weren't better than any of the top 3 - 'No, they lost because they were the 4th best team and they ran into the 3rd best team, who smoked them.' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You read the title. Now's your chance to prove me wrong. You have three ways: For anything in the 'A' section - Prove that its incorrect, source required For anything in the 'B' section - Make a serious, evidence backed explanation against the conclusion. Be specific ""They wouldn't have beat them at tokyo anyways"" isn't enough. ""I don't think they would have beat them at tokyo because their style is a matchup problem"" is a start. ""I don't think they would have beat them at tokyo because their style is a matchup problem, which you can see from..."" is valid. Ideal responses will also explain why the ""A's"" don't support the ""B's"" For anything in the ""C's"" - Just explain what you think is wrong and why Make sure you include which point(s) you're contesting. Serious replies will be met with a serious reply, and vice versa. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All Successful Rebuttals _amBrian noted that Cauanzin wasn't a rookie (internationally), as he had one international event under his belt from his time at NIP (A5)",United States,0,17/9/2024,11:50,17/9/2024,11:50

It's also not very comparable to the Kickoff events of this (2024) year, as those: Were all officially called Kickoff Were all held domestically All included a double elim group stage, a play-in stage, and playoff stage Now, Lock-In was the first part of VCT 2023 Circuit, but that doesn't prove much. It was a special, one-time showcase tourney meant to show off the teams and the new franchise system and create hype around it (which it did). Even still, it was obviously pre-season, and saying it wasn't because it was the first official part of the circuit is like saying the NBA pre-season isn't preseason because it's on the Official NBA Schedule. 100%, without a doubt, pre-season, and the second line is proof, the rest is just context.",United States,-17,17/9/2024,24:57,17/9/2024,11:50

A6. Even the best quality trophy can be broken if the shipping company is shit at their job A9/10: People have bad games? C3. A random agent select tournament would be too RNG to have a quantifiable value as a major event. LOCK/IN's single elim format is not that; it punishes any mistake with elimination. Up until that point, the only other team to win an event without dropping a series was Sen in 2021 (which most people agree wasn't very high quality Valorant), and Acend (which I personally think only happened because of 7 gift-wrapped rounds to Keyd Stars, also had the same problems as Sen's run) Bold = idk how you want us to put a source on this I'll add more once I get a proper read",Vietnam,10,17/9/2024,13:40,17/9/2024,11:50

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"A5 - Turns out you were right about cauanzin, I did not know that. The Point in B2 is still very strong regardless as he obv was not on the level (experience or accomplishment-wise, never been to a final) as either of the people he replaced. But I am fair and will update (see the bottom) A6 - It still broke, so it's still factually correct. Also notice I never used this in a ""B"" to reach a serious conclusion. I just kept it in for symbolism. A9/10 - First of all, its all still factually correct. Secondly, that's definitely not an ordinary bad game. A guy who had 2 kills in a 13-1 loss had a little more than double his (original) rating. Rating might also not capture walling your own team on a site exec. C3 - The metaphor is perfectly valid. Single elim has the exact problem you described. It's not a format designed to select for the best team. Riot obviously went for it to be able to run an event with every team (no qualifiers) logistically (cuz it would obv take forever). From Riot's official valorant esports page, emphasis mine: We wanted to kick off the next era of the VALORANT Champions Tour with an epic tournament that brought together the entire VALORANT community. With LOCK//IN our goal is to lay storytelling groundwork for the 2023 season while thrilling fans with high stakes competition. To build the largest tournament in the history of our sport, we had to consider different formats that could accommodate the largest number of teams we've ever had at a single event. After reviewing many options, it became clear that to be as globally inclusive as we wanted, a single elimination format was the direction we needed to take. While we think this is the best way to kick off the 2023 season, we plan to return to a double elimination format for future international events. Not enough to convince you? What about single elim + preseason (Rosters with literally 0 match experience prior to the event)? Not enough? How about anecdotal evidence: Do you think the strength of Furia's performance vs FNC and KC's vs LOUD at Lock-in were solidly representative of their true strength and should be taken as a serious result?",United States,-9,17/9/2024,14:40,17/9/2024,11:50
Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"The level of nitpicking you do would also prove that Aspas is not the GOAT of Valorant. It also would mean that Tenz mechanically is atrociously overrated. The fact that FNC is one of the very few teams who have made it to almost all the masters and champions events itself makes them one of the most consistent teams to exist. Only other who are close to match FNC is PRX. PRX have had better placements than FNC in few events. But their consecutive wins in 2023 does even them out. And also I don't understand your obsession with FNC. FNC has never been in discussion as much as SEN OR PRX. You are talking about a team which has been dominating Tier 1 since 2021, while your own is struggling to make out of Tier 2 even though they were the first ones in the Valorant scene.

The playoffs for the World Cup is single elim but no-one starts going ""L format"" because of that, it has prestige because every country has a chance to win. Lockin had every vct team at the time and they all had the chance to win, if a team lost but were apparently better, their team should have gone and won then shouldn't they. Single elim just requires your team not to choke, the only downside is that the people who come second, third and fourth might be wrong as they may have been beaten by the winner previously.

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"Firstly, you acknowledged the point is true. Nothing has been refuted. The playoffs for the World Cup is single elim but no-one starts going ""L format"" because of that, it has prestige because every country has a chance to win real sports != esports, And are you sure about no-one?. Most events that aren't double elim have to do with either logistics or physicality or because of variance that is uncontrollable. The world cup would be extremely long (logistics)(brings the city its hosted in to a halt). It's not a good idea to have multiple boxing bouts to decide the champ or for the superbowl matchup to be multiple times for athlete safety reasons (physicality). If you ran or swam the 200m final multiple times, you could feasibly have multiple winners. How do you decide which is the 'real' outcome? You can't, so you just run it once (variance). etc. Single elim just requires your team not to choke Could say the exact same thing about random-agent select. If any team at lockin like Nrg Loud c9 or 100T should of won(I name these teams because you're an americas cringer) why didn't they, because they played worse than the team that beat them or crumbled Do you think the strength of Furia's performance vs FNC and KC's vs LOUD at Lock-in were solidly representative of their true strength and should be taken as a serious result?

That's why you need a regular season to establish yourself, a qualifier to identify the top contenders, and a format designed to select for the best team. That's how we know FPX was the best team at the time of Copenhagen, LOUD the best at Istanbul, etc. Without those things you have a wild west.

That's why I compared it to a Random Agent Select tourney, because the exact same dismissal can be made. Whether it is representative to the rest of the year is meaningless Actually, if the tourney has serious issues, and the results don't match up with the experience of the rest of the year, that's extremely strong evidence that we shouldn't have taken it seriously. There's a reason we didn't crown 100T the best team in the world just cause of RBHG, or whoever else woulda won it.

It not lining up with the rest of the year shouldn't take anything away from them.

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"Alright, I’ll pick it apart. (this took so long) Also, I’m not going to argue about dumb stuff like “mickey mouse tourney” or whatever. If you want evidence for something, ask. I’m too lazy to link every single one of my claims. (Oh, and A8-10 and B4 makes no sense to me, what are you arguing? And A6 made me laugh so hard) First: 2024 Valorant is very different from 2023 Valorant. 2024 requires a much more aggressive playstyle, you need to do mid round reclears, more fakes, etc… to be able to do well. 2023 Valorant was more about the info game. Being able to check where they are, deny/gain information, etc… was the most important things. FNC were really good at 2023 Valorant. They mostly suck at 2024 Valorant. It’s a big reason why they started to do much worse in 2024 vs 2023. (Though part of it is also the anti-strat). Every Top 2024 Team was very good at knowing when to take space/push out. Every Top 2023 Team(outside of maybe PRX) was good at the info game. This directly leads to the problem of that 2024 performance is not a good indicator of what might have happened in 2023, which makes A14-18 and B5 mostly irrelevant. (Part of this is an opinon, but I think it makes sense.) The other one major point is that LOUD’s playstyle hardcounters FNC. FNC like to play slow, have one person at every contestion point, and then decide what to do based on what the opponents give up. (E.g, being able to rotate from hearing where PRX pushed out, or using Utility to find them doubled up somewhere, or where the op is) But, LOUD like to do solo/double pushes, which means LOUD is often taking 2v1s or 1v1s before FNC can get set up, which in turn make the round spiral out of control. This is why DRX 13-1’d FNC, if you watch the game, DRX just kept doing these solo/double pushes, getting a man advantage, then each player of FNC feels pressured to make a play to even it, but fails, making the round worse and worse. Combined with Val’s snowball problem, it just became a complete disaster. FNC also hard counters PRX, but this time you can probably guess why. I don’t think I need to explain it, and PRX got absolutely stomped on by FNC at Tokyo, I do not believe for a second PRX could’ve won with something unless he somehow becomes god and gets three every round. Essentially, at champs, I think: FNC <= EG FNC << LOUD FNC >> PRX They simply got unlucky and played LOUD twice. (C4) One other thing that bothers me: I understand people will call Lock//In a fake tourney. But even so, FNC won Lock//In AND Tokyo. FNC winning Lock//In isn’t a fluke. They had the ability to win twice. Even if you want to argue about LOUD choking and EG not being fully preped, FNC then would’ve got 2nd both events. (FNC >> PRX like I said earlier). It’s not a fluke. They were at worst the second best team in the world for two events in a row. Now, to address each point: C1-3; agree. C4, explained above B1 - not sure what this is supposed to mean B2 - would still be second in the world at worst, and being able to comeback is also partly from them, not just LOUD choking. (Also, maybe this is wrong, but I feel like the two new guys were actually the most impactful during the choke? I forgot tho) B3 - don’t care B4 - ? B5 - explained B6 - maybe, I would lean 55/45 or 60/40 EG A's are all facts, but some of them I don’t understand and/or don’t think support the argument all that well.",United States,1,24/9/2024,11:49,17/9/2024,11:50
Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"You failed to meet the conditions for a successful rebuttal (see the last paragraph, but you did it generally too). But since this clearly took a lot of effort, I'll give a semi-serious reply I'm gonna stick to everything between 'first : ' and 'essentially at champs' so I keep this under the character limit, but I will get to the rest in follow-up 2024 requires a much more aggressive playstyle, you need to do mid round reclears, more fakes, etc… to be able to do well. 2023 Valorant was more about the info game. Being able to check where they are, deny/gain information, etc… was the most important things. FNC were really good at 2023 Valorant. They mostly suck at 2024 Valorant. It’s a big reason why they started to do much worse in 2024 vs 2023. (Though part of it is also the anti-strat). Every Top 2024 Team was very good at knowing when to take space/push out. Every Top 2023 Team(outside of maybe PRX) was good at the info game Everybody did mid round reclears and fakes in 2023 (fns had somebody retaking the wrong site in 2023). Alot of these points are too general (by what basis can you say denying/gaining info the most important thing, or even more important in 2023 vs 2024?). But the bigger problem is that some of them are straight up wrong - 2024 was by far less aggressive than 2023, until arguably the emergence of Neon at the very end. The biggest factor being the nerf of skye killing double duelist comps. Compare the LA grand final vs the Madrid grand final LA: 6 double duelist comps - Both on Split, PRX on Ascent, Both on Bind, PRX on Lotus (counting chamber as a duelist because lets be real, he is and always was, 1 trip ain't stopping a site hit) Madrid : 2 double duelist comps - GENG on Breeze and Split (and at shanghai finals they only kept the double duelist on breeze, which was the only 1 in that entire series) Besides the death of double duelist, 2024 Valorant was extremely retake heavy - SEN's Madrid run was a shining example of this. Furthermore, we saw stuff like no duelist comps altogether become popular on icebox. So your claim isn't really matching reality. This directly leads to the problem of that 2024 performance is not a good indicator of what might have happened in 2023, which makes A14-18 and B5 mostly irrelevant. (Part of this is an opinon, but I think it makes sense.) The more time further out, the less weight we can put on it, obviously. But let's imagine for a sec if the shoes were on the other foot. Imagine If Alfajer (at the time EMEA MVP) (and eventual Tokyo MVP) wasn't at Tokyo with Fnatic. Then imagine a pubg streamer replaced him, not even a pro or a streamer that mainly plays val. Then, PRX smacked FNC around. Finally, imagine at the very next tournament (just a month later with no matches in-between), FNC with Alfajer is better than PRX, and this trend continues for a long time afterwards, regardless of meta change. What do you think this implies? The other one major point is that LOUD’s playstyle hardcounters FNC. FNC like to play slow, have one person at every contestion point, and then decide what to do based on what the opponents give up. (E.g, being able to rotate from hearing where PRX pushed out, or using Utility to find them doubled up somewhere, or where the op is) But, LOUD like to do solo/double pushes, which means LOUD is often taking 2v1s or 1v1s before FNC can get set up, which in turn make the round spiral out of control. This is why DRX 13-1’d FNC, if you watch the game, DRX just kept doing these solo/double pushes, getting a man advantage, then each player of FNC feels pressured to make a play to even it, but fails, making the round worse and worse. Combined with Val’s snowball problem, it just became a complete disaster. Even if we assume it was purely LOUD's playstyle which led to their victory (they were also just better). It's not like LOUD is the only team capable of doing those things, or that other playstyle's can't be successful vs FNC. In fact, the most direct evidence that we have suggests PRX's playstyle is successful against Fnatic. Further still, PRX are famously successful against the EMEA playstyle, with a literal reputation as the 'European Reapers'. FNC also hard counters PRX, but this time you can probably guess why. I don’t think I need to explain it, and PRX got absolutely stomped on by FNC at Tokyo, I do not believe for a second PRX could’ve won with something unless he somehow becomes god and gets three every round. Total Bullshit. Re-read everything in the paragraph above. There is literally nothing to support this view. In fact, every single piece of evidence available (B5/A11-A18) contradicts this view. And this exact type of low-effort sentence was banned for a reason in the rules (and your exact argument was used as an example). 'I don't need to explain it' Then you can't prove Fnatic was great.

Okay, I'm going to try to simplify everything now, as it's getting kinda confusing and hard to tell what's going on. Earlier in this thread, you mentioned: I could summarize virtually everything in 4 lines: Fnatic was never considered the best in the world prior to franchising Lock In was mickey mouse for multiple clear reasons EG and PRX obviously weren't at full strength at tokyo What happened at Tokyo and immediately afterwards - and for a while after that - strongly suggests both of those teams at full strength were better than Fnatic. I'll address each point, and use some stuff I've been saying. Fnatic was never considered the best in the world prior to franchising Means absolutely nothing. It's true, but what people think is going to happen has no real effect on what will happen. Lock In was mickey mouse for multiple clear reasons Not going to debate this too much, but you have to keep in mind FNC got first and would've been top two even with said asterisks in both Tokyo and Lock//In. EG and PRX obviously weren't at full strength at tokyo Fair, but FNC is always >> PRX imo even at full strength. Again, even if EG were better and would've won, FNC still gets 2nd. What happened at Tokyo and immediately afterwards - and for a while after that - strongly suggests both of those teams at full strength were better than Fnatic. The ""while after that"" is the main thing wrong. As #113 shows, 2024 is VERY different from 2023. 2024 success/failures are not a good representation of what would've happened in 2023. All right, I'll sum it all up: FNC won BOTH Lock//In and Tokyo. Even if you want to argue FNC wouldn't have won both because of the choke and EG, then FNC are still top 2 in both events FNC >> PRX due to matchup problem, even with PRX at full strength 2024 results are not good indicator of 2023 results, meaning there is no way to properly compare PRX and FNC, and the matchup problem is very evident from 2023. LOUD >> FNC due to matchup problem FNC played LOUD twice, they got unlucky. Worst case scenario, while being reasonable: Lock//In - 2nd (LOUD wins) Tokyo - 2nd (EG wins) Champions - 3rd (EG and LOUD would beat FNC) FNC are clearly a top team of 2023.",United States,0,1/10/2024,7:48,17/9/2024,11:50

It depends. Although a good chamber COULD be really strong, PRX also showed that they could easily beat chamber when needed. Easily is a bit of a stretch f0rsakeN was a perfectly respectable chamber I agree, he definitely wasn't bad, but when you think of the top chambers you think of Yay, Ardiss, Cryo, Derke, and even Laz before thinking of Forsaken Huh? I've been trying to explain that FNC >> PRX due to playstyle. PRX >> most of EMEA is fair, but PRX vs FNC isn't the same, especially during 2023, as most of EMEA that year was complete shit Yes but your reasoning for why FNC >>> PRX playstyle was circular (see below). In their only previous encounter PRX won, and PRX has generally done well against european teams across multiple years, not just 2023. I think FNC is a really bad matchup for PRX and FNC basically always wins, especially during 2023 So not only was your argument for this circular, but we've gone full circle and started at the beginning. Your evidence for why FNC would beat full-strength PRX at Tokyo due to matchup/style advantage was solely based on Tokyo. That is circular reasoning (or at least super close). I hate that people call cgrs a streamer when talking about him. It's true that he used to stream. But he quickly learned during Tokyo and managed to become a perfectly respectable player during Tokyo. He wasn't a complete liability or anything, he was just slightly worse than average. Well, he was basically a streamer until that point. He wasn't even in challengers, despite trying. And even though he (miraculously) exceeded what you could've reasonably expected from him, he was still bottom 5 statistically for the whole tournament. 'Fnatic was never considered the best in the world prior to franchising' Means absolutely nothing. It's true, but what people think is going to happen has no real effect on what will happen That line is a quick summary from the original post('Fnatic was never great') of pre-franchising Fnatic. Basically just says Fnatic was never great (#1 in the world) at any point pre-franchising. Nobody really argues that anyways, which is why the bulk of it focuses on franchising. 'Lock In was mickey mouse for multiple clear reasons' Not going to debate this too much, but you have to keep in mind FNC got first and would've been top two even with said asterisks in both Tokyo and Lock//In Yeah and? Doesn't matter if LOUD, NAVI, NRG, DRX or even C9 won it. It's mickey mouse regardless, and therefore I don't take any result from it seriously. 'EG and PRX obviously weren't at full strength at tokyo' Fair, but FNC is always >> PRX imo even at full strength. and we've come full circle 'EG and PRX obviously weren't at full strength at tokyo' Again, even if EG were better and would've won, FNC still gets 2nd 2nd is good, but not enough to be great. Winning matters. The only reason Mako isn't the unquestionable goat controller is because he couldn't win. Lock//In - 2nd (LOUD wins) Lock-in doesn't matter regardless Tokyo - 2nd (EG wins) Could even be 3rd, behind PRX and EG Champions - 3rd (EG and LOUD would beat FNC) You know we actually know what happened at champs without hypotheticals, right? All teams were full strength, they got 4th. FNC are clearly a top team of 2023 True, but they were never great.

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"I have time now, so I'll link my claims. But the bigger problem is that some of them are straight up wrong - 2024 was by far less aggressive than 2023, until arguably the emergence of Neon at the very end. Also note # of duelists has nothing to do with how aggressive a team is. It's somewhat correlated, but not a direct factor. And I heavily disagree with you pulling up Madrid stats. The first tournament always has an unclear meta. The second has a mostly developed meta. The third has the fully grown meta but also teams trying to counter the meta.(In general) It's why I heavily prefer using Tournament Two for any general claims about that year. Alright, let's look at Gen.G vs TH Shanghai Finals. Therfore, Neon is still bad. Both Gen.G and TH did well in two tournaments, so I think it's good comparison for the overall. I'm going to be looking at map 5, as I think it was the best demonstration. Also, Split was played in both games. I'll go round by round. (Only paying attention to not eco rounds) Map 5:  Round 1: Gen.G start by instantly throwing a two man fake toward B. However, their fake doesn't work, and it trades 1 for 1. After this fighting, we can see that TH IMMEDIATELY go for a midround reclear of Ramp. Round 3: TH DON""T do a reclear of B-Main until later, and therefore don't have the proper rotations and lose the site and the round Round 4: Gen.G explode out of buy phase, insta rush Round 5: Gen.G push up mid and claim B-Heaven in five seconds. This quickly transitions into a swift execute. Round 6: Gen.G push up B-Main. TH immediately fights for A-Main in response and get a kill. They now win the round. (First round win = First time mid round aggro) Round 7: Gen.G just bomb it up B and quickly exec. Round 8: TH once again doesn't midround clear B-Main fast enough, can't hold onto A as they don't have the rotates and therefore lose the site and the round Round 10: Gen.G quickly take Ramp control, but it's a fake. TH completely take the bait, instead of possible taking control B-Main, and yet again lose the site and the round. Round 11: First round where aggro isn't super evident. However, TH DID take early B-Main control, and therefore were able to stack A. Again, when they take space aggressively they win the round. Round 12: Gen.G run it up B-Main, but Munchkin is unable to find anything B and they can't break past the site hold. Round 13: First round where I think there isn't much aggro at all. Gen.G did somewhat control A-Main, but not really. Round 14: Gen.G has no info or control of any of the map, and they lose the opening kill. They fail to get the trade and falls it to a 2v3. However, Gen.G are able to clutch it out. Round 15: Both teams fight for A main control. In response, Pati quickly takes B-Main for free. However, TH never makes any pressure elsewhere and therefore Gen.G stacks A. They win the round. Round 16: TH fight for Mid, then B-Main. Gen.G lets them and denies the space, knowing that they cannot allow them control. Basically, from this game, we saw: two(Maybe three if you count munchkin trying something A) fakes nine times where Gen.G pushed somewhere quickly from the start of the barrier without masking it four times a team was punished for not reclearing fast enough or didn't take space Three times a team DID do a midround reclear or fast space taking which led to a win. This is clearly very aggressive. Let's compare it to Map Two of FNC vs EG Tokyo Finals. Link:  Round 1: EG quietly take mid, However, FNC have a trap prepared. It kinda fails, and they trade 2 for 2. Round 3: Both teams are fighting for B-Main. HOWEVER, note that both sides are masking it. They both are trying to deny information. EG quickly leave and tries to fight mid, but FNC has the read. Again, notice how FNC are hiding their footsteps. Round 4: FNC are once again giving up no information and setting up a mid trap. For some reason, it isn't sprung. (Not sure why) After FNC fall down a player, they DO NOT attempt a midround reclear or anything similar. Instead, they play to the sites. HOWEVER, EG gave up the info they were pushing A too early, and FNC have the players in time and manage to defend the site. Round 5: First round something aggressive happens right off the barrier. (Round 4 has sky dog first and they didn't take mid, they let dog first clear mid). However, FNC once again have a trap(without giving it away until it was sprung). EG never pretend they are going somewhere else, so FNC stays on A. Round 7: EG take mid somewhat fast. FNC do not do any reclears, they let EG have the space and play toward the sites. However, this fails, as demon1 gets a kill and EG now has the man advantage. FNC gambles A, guesses wrong, and lose the round. Round 8: EG finds the op with their util, and kill him. After Boaster gets killed as well, FNC yet again do not try for a reclear. They play to the sites and lose the round. Round 9: EG goes aggro again, taking mid quickly. FNC DOES maintain B-Main control this time, but the dog mid was a little too late and EG get to go A through vents. Round 10: wow, EG goes aggro yet again! They attempt a trap play B, but no one gets caught. FNC YET AGAIN do not do any midround takes. They let EG walk up mid for free, and cannot hold the site. Round 11: This time, FNC takes the offensive. They push B-Main early, find no one, but can't rotate in time. They win the round though, from their fast retake thanks to info. Round 12: FNC does the same thing, but EG are waiting. The round falls apart for EG though. (stopping here, this is taking too long, it's been like an hour =/) So, now, we have: 0 fakes Three times EG went aggro without masking it Basically 0 reclears Two times where being aggro on defense led to a win. These numbers are nowhere close to 2024. Is saying Info and Aggression the most important thing in that year an opinion? Sure. But there is evidence backing it up.(read my comments per round) This evidence also proves 2024 is much more aggressive. and this trend continues for a long time afterwards, regardless of meta change This part is what's wrong. The Meta Change IS what made FNC not good this year. If FNC played the same way they did in 2023 in 2024, they would've been crushed. Why do you think FNC did so bad this year? Sure, you can argue Champs, but 2024 does not apply.",United States,1,25/9/2024,8:05,17/9/2024,11:50

Was Fnatic Great? Come Prove it,General Discussion,"At long last ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Also note # of duelists has nothing to do with how aggressive a team is. It's somewhat correlated, but not a direct factor. Yeah i'm not gonna lie, this is a pretty crazy take. I know I'm supposed to back this up with something, but in this case I think it's pretty self-evident why double duelist is inherently more aggressive. I think virtually everybody who follows val comp would say that double duelist being more aggressive than single/none is non-controversial. And I heavily disagree with you pulling up Madrid stats. The first tournament always has an unclear meta. The second has a mostly developed meta. The third has the fully grown meta but also teams trying to counter the meta.(In general) It's why I heavily prefer using Tournament Two for any general claims about that year. The exact same thing I said is still true even if we use your methodology. Tokyo - 2 double duelist comps (Note: EG basically ran triple duelist on Bind) in a 3 game series Shanghai - 1 double duelist comp in a 5 game series R1-> R12 (not putting it all for readability) So one of your big premises for why 2024 is more aggressive is by looking at the finals of Shanghai vs Tokyo, and comparing how many time they went aggro without masking it. One big problem with this analysis is that this aggressiveness is part of GEN.G's specific gameplan for for how TH plays split, where Benjy is usually isolated and trusted to 'get his' as a site anchor (with a player like benjy thats usually a good bet), but GENG realized this and realized they could overwhelm him by pushing the pace (Raze scatter nade to break his trips, double satchel and dunk on him). It's basically rinse and repeat of this specific strat that led to that difference in that stat. And don't take my word for it, take Sliggy's, from his analysis :  At least some of your analysis (I'll be honest, I didn't go through everything) is a bit shaky/misleading too, for example: R10 GENG vs TH, you say they (TH) don't take control of B-Main, but they literally did take control of B main. They start the round by instantly burning a (non-replenishing) Skye flash and One-waying the entrance (which missed lmao). The flash hits nothing, and since in their eyes they have B-main control - Boo's sitting behind a smoke at the entrance - they go and rotate the other players to A where GenG made alot of noise. Boo ends up losing a duel to Meteor and GENG gets a free site plant. R11 GENG vs TH Then, the next round, they start by doing the exact same thing, one-waying and skye-flashing B main (the skye flash is a few secs delayed from the round before, but same thing basically). Even though this is the same thing, only now do you call it aggression. Then, the same thing happens, they send players to rotate A after hearing nothing. Instead of fighting back for that space, GENG just hits A, runs into a viper ult and site stack, and loses. The irony is that though you attribute this round to aggression from TH, they did the same thing as last round, but objectively were less aggressive - Boo straight up leaves B main and backs up to site to jiggle spot, giving up B main for free unlike the round directly prior! In some sense GENG were less aggressive as well, because if they fought back for that space or made their presence known instead of just instantly leaving, it's plausible it would have pulled rotates and their site hit would have worked better. On top of that, you stated you wouldn't include ecos, yet you included R11 (a mastercard thrifty), because it purportedly helped your case about the importance of aggressiveness in 2024 (even though it was less aggressive from both sides in fighting for B main compared to the last round, in which you ignored entirely that they fought for B main), but excluded R9, where the aggression gets punished, this time in mid. So in summary, in the span of three rounds (R9-R11) you Selectively ignore an eco that don't help you point, but include the one that does (R9, R11) Ignore an example of aggression when it didn't work (R10) Tout an example of an objectively less aggressive version of an identical play as a round won by aggression (R10, R11) This is not even to mention the nuance of the entire analysis, such as GenG's specific strat to punish benjy. I don't want to spend the time to write (and you prob don't want to read) a bajillion lines going through every detail of fakes, reclears, aggression, of two games in an entire two year period (look at the wall of text it takes to just break down 3 rounds on just one topic). Let's get back to the big picture, which you summarize in the last lines: The Meta Change IS what made FNC not good this year. If FNC played the same way they did in 2023 in 2024, they would've been crushed. Why do you think FNC did so bad this year? Sure, you can argue Champs, but 2024 does not apply If I understand correctly, you're arguing that because the 2023 meta is different from the 2024, meta, comparing performances from the latter and backpropogating them as a judge of strength isn't appropriate. But the problem is, as you allude to, Champs did happen. We saw that PRX at full strength outperformed Fnatic - in the meta that you say favors them. In fact, the only data we have from the 2023 meta of PRX vs FNC's true level (no asterisks) is PRX performing better, they got 2nd, FNC got 4th. And if you think we can't backpropogate Madrid and Shanghai as further (and yes, weaker, but its still something) evidence because the meta change harms Fnatic, why can't we raise the same objection about how it harmed PRX? if anything the meta change was much more harmful to PRX, we saw them fall off a cliff over the course of 2024, they weren't even a top 2 pacific team by the end, and jingg in particular got basically his career ruined by the changes to skye and raze. If the 2024 meta hurt Fnatic, it almost certainly hurt PRX more, so the trend of PRX being better with something is bolstered by the meta changing and them still being better during those events, let alone their case for how they would've done at Tokyo in the 2023 meta.",United States,-1,3/10/2024,7:28,17/9/2024,11:50

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,nah that makes the roster a whole lot worse you have so much role overlap now al0 - sentinel and duelist (could flex onto flash but isnt very experienced in that role based on stats) tex - sentinel and duelist (could flex onto flash but isnt very experienced in that role based on stats) BennY - duelist and gekko Click - duelist basically your flex is already questionable (though fine for a WC tbh) but the intiator role is just sad If you wanna add tex then replace al0 imo Felix is a must (or Obnoks is you wanna add a bit of experience into the team which it lacks otherwise),Germany,0,16/10/2024,21:06,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"For team Germany id consider LuckeR to replace Benny igl and flex which the team lacks atm Frees up the roles a bit more and allows for a bigger variety of comps to be run (a hyper specialized team isnt necessarily bad for a world cup, but I feel like, when we're making rosters purely on paper, banking on double duelist working out with the huge mix of playstyles present is a bit risky) And then -tex or -al0 for felix again as described in #178",Germany,1,16/10/2024,21:12,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"I feel like the UK roster would probably be better with ardiis and soulcas over aNguiSt and waddle (if you count ardiis as UK) ardiis is very flexible and can be a pretty reliable fragger in the right system, as well as being great for the vibes Meanwhile soulcas has some pretty insane aim and can pop off given the right circumstances, he just has some problems with mental, but on a team with Boaster, ardiis and benjyfishy I feel like the vibes and structure would be good enough for him to pop off and find his form",Wales,1,17/10/2024,3:17,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,I like the idea but would you rather see seasoned pros or young talent here? What do you think?,Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,3:20,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"That is a good point, however I feel like ardiis and soulcas are both quite strong players that are worth taking over aNguiSt and waddle, plus aren't aNguiSt and waddle also both sentinel players?",Wales,0,17/10/2024,3:42,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,I had him originally but had to take him out because his roles clash with luckeRRR. I guess I could take him out and put BennY back in as igl... hmm,Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,4:02,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,couldn´t you trade al0rante with Vince? isn´t al0rante quite good as a smoker and Vince smokes only?,Germany,0,17/10/2024,7:22,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"You could, but if you're only taking smokes into account then I think Vince is a little bit betterthan al0rante. Correct me if I'm wrong, though",Seychelles,1,17/10/2024,7:25,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,Vince is more experienced on smokes but I feel like al0rante is still a great smoker and just the better player overall and as far as I know he´s a second caller as well,Germany,0,17/10/2024,22:31,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"I like that. Although I think in this case is to simply take out heat for Zap as a 1 for 1. cauanzin can play whatever initiator Zap doesn't, and Zap can play Omen on double controller maps if he needs to (e.g. Lotus)",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,4:10,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"UPDATE Still filling in the teams. I've filled in everything up to and including Morroco. Didn't realize this earlier but since I'm taking stats from VLR, tier 2 players have higher ratings and stats on average. So there could be some weird superteams. Mongolia looks really good, for one. So yeah, the simulation's not gonna be 100% accurate, but it should still be hella entertaining :)",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,5:03,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"32 team bracket world cup would honestly be fucking insane icl. Hosted in a good country with a good crowd like Brazil or istanbul it could honestly break records for Valorant imo. Would be lock in but much more competitive as teams would just be formed and no teams would have much prior experience with eachother kinda like lock in with teams that had pre existing cores did good EX.

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"I would LOVE to see this kinda thing, man. Just think of all the rosters and head-to-heads we've never seen before. Would also have the most national pride of any VALORANT tournament ever",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,7:37,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,I would assume though it would be a month or maybe 2 month long tournament (including travel) depending on the format. This would in turn have to make champs end on August or September since I'm assuming Riot would be the one hosting a world cup since I doubt anyone else is (maybe ewc?). You need to give teams time to trial different players and with this world cup it would greatly reduce it if champs ended in October.,Guatemala,1,17/10/2024,9:11,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"Those are fair points. It doesn't really have to be that serious, though. It could just have the team prep of a regular off-season event, only with more teams and therefore more games across more days. The one thing that would probably be affected by this is trials, since this would likely take up at least three weeks when accounting for travel time. I think a pretty simple solution to that is to lift the October 7 date for contracts to end, so that if players want to participate they can probably be signed to a team by the time this comes around in November (I'm assuming November would be the best time for this as it would give players over a month after the tournament ends to prep for the year with their team).",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,9:18,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,Yeah this could work but again if Riot hosts it it being in November I'm pretty sure conflicts with GC champs. Other than that though this would be a good solution. Also I'm sure riot is the only TO that is allowed to host big events like this. I've seen something somewhere a while ago that said something like this.,Guatemala,1,17/10/2024,9:24,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"Riot being the TO for this is good (frankly I don't think any other TO would make much sense anyway). As for GC, they can probably have Champs done before October if they optimize the schedule. Depending on the region, kickoff is currently anywhere from January to March, stage 1 anywhere from February to May, stage 2 anywhere from May to August, and stage 3 from September to October, with random tournaments sprinkled here and there and everywhere, all leading up to Champs which lasts a grand total of 10 days. It's a problem and they need to fix it, even if they don't run a World Cup Also you've had 3 different flags since we started this mini thread ",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,9:32,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,You propose a quite good schedule. I wish this would happen but unfortunately it probably won't happen. They don't have my flag I think so I use a cool looking flag!,Guatemala,1,17/10/2024,9:41,14/10/2024,13:54
VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"Oh no, I'm not recommending this schedule at all. This is the one they currently have. They spend 3 months doing each stage, run 3 stages, also run a kickoff to start the year, run all the offseason-esque tournaments between splits, and then Champs only lasts 10 days. They 100% need to fix this. I say run kickoff in February, then stage 1 from mid-March to mid-May, stage 2 from early June to August, then Champs in late September after Ascension ends. If they want to do a stage 3 for promotion/relegation like they do for tier 2 then they can probably do that in December after the World Cup ends What flag does VLR not have, by the way? I've seen very obscure island flags so I didn't think there were entire countries not added yet",Seychelles,0,17/10/2024,9:47,14/10/2024,13:54

VALORANT World Cup,General Discussion,"UPDATE I ran a sample match between Indonesia (5 T1 players) and Mongolia (5 T2 players) to see if grabbing the stats from tier 2 and evaluating them the same as tier 1 was a mistake... here's the imgur thread  I can probably run a few more test matches before I have everyone filled out (I've got the first 20 or so teams on the list right now, lost count tbh) so lmk if you have any specific matchups you wanna see before I finish all the teams and start running the sim Edit: nvm I'm now realizing it's because I had role conflicts on the Indonesian team because I set 3 of them to controller.

I will take racist, transphobic, toxic community that cares about the game rather than fangirls that are creepy af and have 0 knowledge about Valorant and pro Valorant and also does not gave af about current state the game, watch some platchat increase about games understanding they NA bias and cursing teams left and right but u still are gaining something and ngl they are funny af I want unhinged casting in vct and u Throw rex fans might have to vod review PRX playstyle ( They are still grouping up to take fights in defense to get number advantage in heavy retake meta, they are playing like its 2023 your deathball ain't working anymore and spatial DFM pearl 13-1 loss, there macro is so shit makes me question if they should bring a dedicated igl instead Forsaken doing everything) .

So I have to call it out cuz these so called fans are nothing but FRAUDS so I will them call out bcuz they were nowhere to be find when DRX was Vision Striker APAC's only hope before PRX and where are XERXIA fans (now Talon) aren't they Thai u have god of valorant rank god primmie and u still galze EDG where are primmie fangirls ohh wait they do not exist but boys where very respectful towards him cuz we know how hard it is to reach immo 3 (bcuz hackers,boosted player, trolls and if u criticize them for bad play u will hear rain of racial slurs) let alone hitting rank #1 for 8 acts straight.

obesity in NA,Off Topic,"ofc, all these issues gathered is what makes a huge difference. but nowadays people grow up with a mentality that being fat is not something to be ashamed of and you can be model or anything else If people were already ashamed of it from the beginning, it would have a greater impact than fast foods or anything else. That's what I meant. See, people just do not care about their lives anymore too, for example: ""Smoking cigarettes can kill you"" some people still start to smoke to look cool, because they care about what people thinks about them. like: ""OMG I'll start cigar to be like Andrew Tate to look like a gangster."" So cool ~ ! It is in that sense that I meant it. Inspiration way. Since other people will think you're cool, then you'll keep doing that action. (Being fat in this context) If people hate you, you'll be less comfortable doing it and will try to change since nobody wants to be bad spoken. Still, some countries is cool to be ""diverse"" or more acceptable since it makes you to look cool.

obesity in NA,Off Topic,"This is extremely incorrect for the most part, I'm not saying that fast food serving sizes and the culture around quick and fast shit isn't a problem. It is, but the obesity rate in America disproportionately impacts the poor here, which is sadly a big chunk of the country. I believe the UN report on American poverty highlighted that not only is America the highest inequality gap of all western countries, not to mention a lot of other fucked shit. ""The Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty ranks the most well-off countries in terms of labor markets, poverty, safety net, wealth inequality, and economic mobility. The US comes in last of the top 10 most well-off countries, and 18th amongst the top 21."" ""In terms of access to water and sanitation the US ranks 36th in the world."" In some cities and states it's literally more healthy for you to drink fucking soda then it is the local water supply. Now, with that information and picture painted, you also have to attribute a lot of this to capitalism unfortunately. We have the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world, and we spend double the amount per capita on healthcare out of all OECD countries. So we make money off of people being sick, it's a known fact that Americans today can expect to live short and sicker lives because of our health sector and food industry. The amount of chemicals and sugar we put in every day food is mental, this is even worse for food that is supplied to food pantries for the truly poor. Combine that to the fact that ""healthy food"" isn't accessible to rural areas, and some cities, or the education to be healthier in general. With all that being said it's a complex topic, with many layers, and even all of the things I'm talking about is really only some of what is contributing to American Obesity. People are fat, people make fun of fat people, and for me personally I think it's probably healthier to make fun of it then stew in depression or anger at a government that openly preys on it's people and make them heavily sick and dependent on the government to survive. That goes for most things in life, I'd rather find the humor in it then cry about it. But to state something like the OP as the leading cause to a major issue in such a fucking simple way just isn't it fam. Gotta stop being willfully ignorant about the world and educate yourself about the complexity of our reality, nothing is as simple as we wish it was.",United States,4,15/2/2023,16:37,15/2/2023,15:17

You can try to put the blame on the general public for not trying to at least learn to eat healthy, but whenever: your country doesn't really have any healthy ""national dishes"" and, many people don't have any sort of cultural influence leading them towards healthy food, as well as people living in lower income areas where cheap and accessible healthy food is harder to acquire, it makes the whole scenario a little understandable.

obesity in NA,Off Topic,"1) because the US is a developed country, they have quick and easy access to cheap, unhealthy, fast-food chains. fast-food industry market size is ~$370 billion by revenue. there are also approx. 200,000 fast food locations in the US. 2) people eat more calories than they burn. the normal avg calorie intake should be 2800 while those in the US consume approx 3600 kcal. only 23% of americans exercise regularly, with women exercising ~15 minutes per day and men exercising ~25 minutes per day. to contrast, ~60% people in italy exercise regularly, contributing to their lower obesity rate of ~20%. 3) americans consume too much deep-fried foods, meats (beef, pork, chicken etc), and sugary/salty snacks. deep-fried foods are high in “bad fats” such as trans and saturated fats. once you consume too much, they will just be held in your body until the energy is needed. same goes with carbohydrates, these are generally “quick” forms of energy, but any excess will be stored in your body. meats and salty snacks are high in fats and sodium which increases cholesterol levels. basically all of these unhealthy foods lead to high chance of heart diseases, cancers since they lead to huge weight/fat gain. 4) eating so much food is just normalized when it really shouldnt be. sure eat out a few times a week but once you do it so often, once or twice a day, you are bound to gain weight. restaurant food generally does taste better than homemade food because chefs add excess of certain unhealthy products (sodium, oil, butter). plus society has normalized “eat whatever you want as long as it makes you happy.” no, dont eat whatever you want unless you have ways of burning all the calories or getting more of the good nutrients to counteract the bad ones because it will heavily affect your bodily systems and functions as soon as you hit you mid-adult age. sure its fine to treat yourself as long as you can do something to maintain healthiness (this could be working out, adding more nutrients, and dont sit all day!). ++ WE CAN BE BODY POSITIVE WITHOUT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO CONTINUE UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLES! tldr: too much fast food, more food but less exercise, junk food, normalizing being obese is why americans are humongous !

obesity in NA,Off Topic,"The statement that ""oh my god don't fat shame!!"" contributes to enabling the obesity pandemic is a flawed one that overlooks the complex and multifaceted nature of obesity. Obesity is a serious public health issue that affects millions of people around the world and is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, and according to the CDC, more than 42% of adults in the United States are considered obese. However, blaming the issue of obesity on ""fat-shaming"" is misguided and ignores the root causes of the problem. One of the primary causes of obesity is poor nutrition. Many Americans consume high amounts of processed foods and sugary drinks, which are high in calories but low in nutrients. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, only 1 in 10 adults in the United States eat enough fruits and vegetables. In addition, a lack of physical activity is also a significant contributor to obesity. Sedentary lifestyles, long working hours, and technological advancements have all contributed to a decrease in physical activity, which has led to an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Furthermore, genetics and biology play a role in obesity. Some people are more genetically predisposed to obesity, which can make it more challenging to maintain a healthy weight. Environmental factors also play a role, including access to healthy food options, safe and accessible places to exercise, and socioeconomic status. These factors can disproportionately affect certain populations, such as those living in low-income areas or communities of color. Blaming obesity on ""fat-shaming"" is not only inaccurate, but it can also be harmful. Stigmatizing individuals who are overweight or obese can lead to further negative health outcomes. Studies have shown that weight stigma can lead to stress, depression, and other mental health issues, which can lead to poor health outcomes, including an increased risk of obesity. It is also important to note that obesity is a complex issue that cannot be solved by simply shaming individuals into losing weight. In conclusion, obesity is a significant public health issue that affects millions of people around the world. While it is important to promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles, blaming obesity on ""fat-shaming"" is misguided and ignores the root causes of the problem. Instead, a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex and multifaceted nature of obesity is needed to address this issue. This approach should include promoting healthy nutrition and physical activity, addressing socioeconomic disparities and access to healthy food options, and reducing weight stigma and discrimination. By taking a holistic approach, we can work to reduce the prevalence of obesity and improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities.",United Kingdom,3,16/2/2023,3:24,15/2/2023,15:17

Instead of resorting to personal attacks, it is essential to engage in a thoughtful and respectful dialogue that promotes education and awareness surrounding the issue of obesity. It's important to remember that addressing obesity is a collective effort that requires empathy, understanding, and a willingness to work together to achieve our common goals of promoting health and well-being.",United Kingdom,2,16/2/2023,3:30,15/2/2023,15:17

A fan asked Saadhak on stream like a month ago if they would leak strats to SENTINELS because Fnatic were scared to scrim with LOUD for that reason. Saadhak joked around or something and said he will tell Pancs (pANcada) but he wasnt serious obviously.

If Riot did this, would be imputing a crime to pancc, and pancc would have a good guaranteed lawsuit against riot. Riot's rulebook prohibits swearing etc out of game, why can't it have a stance on pedophilia of players? arguably a much more signifant issue. Riot doesn't prohibit swearing, it prohibits HATE SPEECH, which you know is a crime. are you stupid? i literally said it's nothing to do with a crime - it's Riot's decision to blacklist someone. they can blacklist someone regardless of what they have done. If Riot ban someone with no valid justification, they would face consequences (like a lawsuit), and it would open a lot of precedents, As I already said. he was within the law but as i literally just said in my last reply that doesn't mean he wasn't in the wrong. If he wasn't really wrong, Riot can't do nothing. : MORALLY Riot should do something (blacklist) irrelevant of any LEGAL (for law!) conditions because PEOPLE (not governments) agree that pedophilia is morally wrong.

So lets say loud did as good as they did in Americas we'd probably see Americas have 3 teams in the top 4. Pacific is also in a rut rn considering DRX are falling off hard (probably internal issues). PRX are also an insane team but without Something they clearly werent able to change their style enough to make GF. Both of these factors paralleled by the fact that EMEA literally had no issues outside of Navi being too used to trolling their games and still having the tourney be more dominant in Pacific and NA just goes to show that EMEA is by far the weakest region.

Sentinels look good on paper but with no actual IGL and a slight language barrier & lack of chemistry i just dont see it happening. Most top teams nowadays have a core which has ideally been together since the start of the game. Sen just put a few brazilians in a former NA Masters pot and called it a day. C9 is probably the most promising team out of all. But i think if you play C9 vs Liquid/NaVi 1000x times, Liquid/NaVi wins over 700 of the games. My ranking currently: EG C9 (hot take?)

"Deep-thinkers, come (worldview discussion)",Off Topic,"I'm bored, let's yap. Have you ever heard of a logical conclusion and have you ever tested if you would agree with the logical conclusion of your worldview? Here's how it works: We all have a set of values and beliefs. These are all justified by some kind of source/logic. A logical conclusion tests whether you would agree with something else that used the same source/logic to get there. If you wouldn't, then you should reflect upon your worldview before it comes back to bite you in the ass. That's the idea, at least. For example, I believe there is nothing wrong with A because it is legal. Someone then asks, am I also okay with B, which is also legal. If my answer is no, then my worldview is illogical because it can't be used to justify two different things that use the same source/logic. -To explain this example better, the problem isn't the fact I believe B is bad and A is okay even though they're both legal. The problem is the fact I am using ""legal"" as the justification for why A is good but I won't give B the same level of respect. It means that ""legal"" isn't my real justification and there is another reason as to why I think A is okay but B is not.-",Europe,5,8/9/2024,18:01,8/9/2024,18:01

If i'm the one that make law i'll consider spirit of the law > law itself (like in rugby, contrary to football), if not you create loophole, the problem with that system is that they are a glimpse of arbitrary, but you can modulate that by making a council where everyuser can say if that's break the law or the spirit of the law to avoid arbitrary.

I don't even disagree with this but I think you're looking a step ahead of what I'm talking about. I'll show you below. If we talk about political rules, then I'll consider justice > rule, What is ""justice"", what is the source/logic to determine whether or not something is wrong or right? That's the worldview. And more importantly, is the worldview consistent. I'll give a very blatant and relevant (mods please don't ban) example just to really show you what I mean and why being consistent is important. Rule: Women should have the right to abortions. Logic: Women should have full reproductive rights and should be able to decide what they do with their bodies. Logical conclusion: There are no exceptions in which a woman should be denied an abortion, even if the baby was due in the next 5 minutes. Incosistency: If I disagree with the abortions in the case of 5 minutes left, then I am denying women's full reproductive rights which is inconsistent with my worldview. This doesn't neccessarily make me wrong, it just means I can't stick to my worldview the moment I come across something I don't like the sound of, and so why am I advocating for it?

""This is where having strong foundations comes in and finding a worldview that goes deeper than our emotions."" My worldview isn't based on ""emotion"", empathy about theoretical hypothesis is important to make rules, not to take decisions, this is 2 different things.

Okay, let me test your consistency. Do you apply the same logic to the fact people feel bad killing animals i.e. cows, dogs, birds, chickens, anything really. All animals are below human beings in consiousness and are unable to process thoughts to the degree that humans do, we have no reason to care about them outside of their utility yet people cry whenever their pets die. Would you agree that this is also illogical and a consequence of social conditioning? If so, then your worldview is consistent and I'd have nothing to push back on (which makes it a strong worldview).

That would make sense to me. If I don't care about a human fetus, why on would I ever care about a dog. I have even less of a bioligical connection to the dog than the fetus, and I already have no bioligical connection to the fetus. If your worldview is consistent, you would agree with me.

"Deep-thinkers, come (worldview discussion)",Off Topic,"Finally. This is my kind of conversation. I do agree that in most cases, when someone believes A is justified while B is not, there is at least a little bit of inherent bias. However, as Nachtel may have pointed out, it's not very fair to be comparing any two things to each other, as A could be justified for a reason that, if used for B, wouldn't make any sense. For example, let's say there's no law indicated you must stay off of quiet, secluded neighbourhood roads. If you are jaywalking on a secluded arterial road, you could argue that it's legal, and that would be justified since residents of the area have as much right to these quiet roads as vehicles do, there's not much risk or harm that can come from simply crossing that road, and frankly there's not really a better alternative when you consider the distance to the crosswalk, the time it takes to get there, and the amount of risk you're mitigating. On the other hand, let's say you are sitting down, cross-legged, right in the middle of that same road. You could argue that it's legal—and you'd be right, because there's no law set in place telling you to stay off that road—but logically you can understand that this argument isn't enough to validate the action. In other words, it's still wrong. He's sitting right in the middle of the road. There's danger of injury from the cars wanting to pass through every several minutes; there's danger of infection from cuts they could get from the uneven paving; and it's just a stupid thing to be doing, no matter how you look at it. Sure, it's legal, but context matters. You're not quickly crossing the road, you're meditating in the middle of it. These are two very different contexts that require very different explanations as to why you think they're justified. I understand the point you're trying to make—and I agree with that point, for the most part; if you want to back up what you're doing, you need to be open-minded and ready to accept others that are doing different things for the same reason. But there's a context to everything that we as humans do, and that context couldn't be more important in situations like these. (Also this may not have been the most relevant example, but it was the first one to come to mind. Let me know if this example doesn't really make sense with what you're talking about)",Seychelles,1,8/9/2024,23:26,8/9/2024,18:01
"Deep-thinkers, come (worldview discussion)",Off Topic,"Nah, it's a good example. It captures why I find this topic interesting and worth thinking about. A logically-consistent worldview is very strong but it can lead to circumstances which are unfavourable even though they are justified. The breaking-point is whether that unfavourable circumstance is enough to make you change your mind, thus weakening the core of your worldview. If the law is always true, except for when you don't like it, then is it always true? Not really. Of course, this is mostly theory since practically nobody is this perfect. However, it is very difficult to argue against a worldview that accepts all of its logical faults without appealing to morality and then you'd have to explain why they should accept your morality (which is a different topic of its own).",Europe,1,8/9/2024,23:45,8/9/2024,18:01

"Deep-thinkers, come (worldview discussion)",Off Topic,"I think your set of values and beliefs is strongly influenced by the environment in which you are raised/grow up and the values and beliefs of individuals that you view as being either accomplished or successful in one way or another, therefore you attribute their opinions and beliefs with greater weight than those of people you may deem to be less accomplished by social standards, similar to how a lot of people assume that politicians need to fulfill a number of prerequisites in order to be able to lead a party or governmental body effectively. Also,, as I believe was mentioned earlier, everybody is a hypocrite to a certain extent, predominantly because in today's society, there are very set beliefs and fundamentally established approaches to situations that most people won't be willing to stray from out of fear that they'll be ostracised for it, regardless of whether those norms coincide with their own beliefs or not. Humans are very social beings, thus having opinions and beliefs that differ too far from the norm would be opposing that desire. Just recently had an extensive conversation regarding the upcoming presidential election, heard a lot of opinions, most of which I personally agreed with but some that I didn't, chose not to voice those opinions on account of trying to avoid a debate :) Assuming we had a scenario where we were to take a bunch of children with little to no contact to other individuals, being provided with literature that serves no other purpose than to educate them on how the world is functioning (an objective, unopinionated display of how things are done), I think it would be interesting to hear what their opinions would be if confronted with various socially challenging scenarios (issues concerning race, gender, substance use, etc.), because I think its quite difficult for an individual, who grew up the ""normal"" way to stay perfectly objective (if there is such a thing) when it comes to making decisions on any topic really. Obviously that will never happen due to that being highly unethical by social standards, as well as quite unfeasible to pull off anyway, considering the investments and logistics of it all.

man what to do with my life,Off Topic,"Firstly, extremely relatable post. Sometimes I wish I could go back to secondary school when all I could look forward to is going home, playing PS4 with my mates and watching my favourite YouTubers. Unfortunately, time does not go backwards and you have to embrace the future. Figure out what you enjoy and what you're good at. If you're good at numbers, take up a numerical degree like Economics, CompSci, etc. If you're good at more verbally-written assignments, History or some sort of analytical field would be good. Then when it comes close to graduating, you should look at doing some internships, summers/weeks in a company to get experience so you can then apply it to the things you enjoy. And what you enjoy will always change so keep it close to you. Being financially free is subjective to a certain extent, but if you have a good job (i.e.: you don't work retail or food services for the rest of your life), you will be mostly financially free. Though American educational debt is annoying, you will probably have enough income to enjoy things from time to time. Now, Sliggy is indeed fortunate to be in the position he is in, but do not discount that he has worked hard to get where he is. He started off as a pro in CS:Source back in 2009 and was a coach in CSGO from 2015. Then he goes to Valorant and coaches pro teams until 2022. In basic terms, he has been working hard for a decade to maintain his presence in a volatile environment like the eSports market. He is now a streamer, but he didn't just sprout knowledge for the game. He has been consistently a thinker-type for years across games - and therefore, he has earned his comfort to stream Valorant pro games and get paid nicely for it. Bare in mind, he is also fairly new to streaming so he isn't raking in huge numbers, but he definitely gets a nice sum of money from his TL contract. All-in-all, there is a lot of hard work you got to commit if you wanna be in Sliggy's position. And this goes for any high quality role, corporate or freelance. If you wanna be a streamer-analyst, start right now as a hobby to stream. Post your VODs or clips to all social medias. Build a brand and network with individuals.",United Kingdom,1,15/12/2024,8:11,15/12/2024,7:47
man what to do with my life,Off Topic,"im good with math logic and numbers kinda, always been fast with calculations mentally and high level maths is fun to figure (extremely fucking hard when you get stuck for hours on end) so I'm thinking maths+cs rn maybe I'll start streaming when im in uni or when I'm done with it",United States,1,15/12/2024,8:14,15/12/2024,7:47
man what to do with my life,Off Topic,"Great that you know what you're good at. Maths was also something I loved. As a degree, it might become something you hate since Pure Maths is the bane of any mathematician due to its abstract nature. But if you are good with coding and logic, CS is a nice degree. Very popular and competitive, but you're almost guaranteed a good job if you're proactive on projects. Plus it can provide an easier pathway into eSports than other disciplines. As for streaming, take my advice and do it sooner than later. If the burden of streaming cannot be balanced with studying, by all means put it on hold, but take the dive first rather than procrastinate it",United Kingdom,1,15/12/2024,8:17,15/12/2024,7:47

After that apply for the colleges/schools without worrying if you'll get accepted or not because you can always reapply. Also, make sure you also apply for a school that has like an 80% - 90% acceptance rate just in case you don't get accepted into your college of choice.

Most important part of geng success.,General Discussion,Solo and hsk are the most important part for geng. They created such a good system for geng.

PRX real fix,General Discussion,"idk if you noticed but it seemed like the movement meta right now is more to burst strafing with a little tiny bit of crouching when bursting (like primmie's). i watch a lot of prx games and in my opinion most of prx's players' mechanics are a bit outdated. don't get me wrong, they still have the best aims, but lacks the movement mechanics. something likes to play high sens (which makes his aim so jittery and inconsistent when it comes to tracking enemy strafes) with a lot of crouch spraying when its mid to close range, but he does strafe when its long range. f0rsaken is a mixture of crouch spraying and strafing d4v41 is a lot of crouch spraying mindfreak is strafing-based but he has subpar aim compared to cracked controllers nowadays ( Ivy, Persia, Karon, etc) jinggg crouch sprays but he is equipped with good aim however, this is a really hot take and I'm open to disagreements.",China,1,3/2/2025,1:19,3/2/2025,12:22

I would rather have forsaken on sentinel he was made for that role some of his plays on kj were insane but that was from 2023.

PRX real fix,General Discussion,"I agree but GenG plays more as a unit, GenGs shanghai run reminded me of PRX champs 2023 run when they had way more control over their agression and would not just simply run out and peek with no follow up util like they have been doing recently. Youre not wrong about something as well I feel like all 5 players individually are still decent enough to be on a winning team but my issue is with their dynamics mainly. Boaster said after not qualifying for madrid that he thinks that theyre all very good friends and dont hold each other accountable during practice. Which was further proved when they bombed out of shanghai. When hiro was added to the team they went on a run in their regionals and did the best they could have done at champs given the high level of competition. Sometimes you just need a change and PRX desperately need a big change. And its high time forsaken stops flexing to this degree at this point he is just feeding his ego his util usage is very mid apart from a couple agents.",Canada,0,3/2/2025,6:05,3/2/2025,12:22

PRX real fix,General Discussion,"-Alecks +IDK who other solution: -Jinggg +Good IGL Also, new Coach and make Alecks into assistant coach (his TO is good and kinda works) My Opinion: I don't think anything is wrong with the roster mechanically and most of the team on the role side. Just let something on the fixed duelist, mindfreak on the controller, davai on initiator and Forsaken on the flex, Jinggg on the sentinel or even just make Jinggg warmed the bench and find some good sentinel IGL. They could get away some rounds just by aim-diff the player from other teams. The problem that I could see immediately is the strat. They look really lost and unable to do any setup (probably didn't even have any). That's why my first solution is the coaching stuff. They could use the W-strat or whatever is it called. They just need that ""controlled chaos"" and that element of surprise. For the last couple of months, they kinda abandoned the WGaming strat and started to follow the meta (which they never did from, IDK, since the start of their teams maybe). And TBH, if they didn't even have that thirst for win, i don't think we can hope anything from this team anymore. TL;DR Go find other coach to be the main coach, and Alecks as an assistant coach. Find replacement for Jinggg, or IDK just keep the Family (to lose) together NT kub .

People nowadays use mental health issues as an insult / joke which is complete bullshit. Whoever bullies people with such issues is nothing short of a piece of shit who deserves nothing in this world. Instead of keeping all of that stuff to yourself, kindly vent it out. If anyone here is facing something they can't cope up with please, I'm here for you. Hit me up on the forums and I will try my best to help out. Your life is very precious.

WHY SOMETHING WOULDNT CHANGE TOURNAMENT RESULTS,General Discussion,"i am not confident he would have. Watching just this tourney has made me think maybe this roster is just as strong as with something BEFORE YOU CALL ME DELUSIONAL I really don't think the other 4 prx members are so far ahead of everyone else in the WORLD that them with a bad player can make it to top 3 in the world. Therefore, I have to reason that for some reason having forsaken back on duelist and cgrs doing initiator has clicked and actually is an equivalent team to something on duelist and forsaken back to a supporting role",United States,0,24/6/2023,16:06,24/6/2023,16:06

Demon1 >= something,General Discussion,Both are around the same tier of player. Tier list wise imo something is around A- to A and Demon1 is A to A+ good quality duelists with amazing teammates around them but I would not consider either of them top 5 yet. Although Demon1 has had a more impressive track record internationally from what I've seen so far.,Sweden,0,17/8/2023,4:15,17/8/2023,4:15
Demon1 >= something,General Discussion,Something owns demon1 since Something literally trolls and somehow hes still fkn MVP of the Match. I don't get it man how he performs like that? I am not biased but like that is literally the fkn truth. In the match vs Kru he was literally doing 360 + randomly smoking on purpose,Turkey,0,17/8/2023,4:17,17/8/2023,4:15
